							<h3>And I Shall Call Them the Tweaker Rich</h3>
							<p class="date">Jun 20, 2007 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_sightings.html">Sightings</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Many of those who live in the <a href="http://www.palms-california.us/staticpages/index.php?page=20051125145006742%23Anchor-CHARNOCK-37516">Charnock Ranch Historic Business Area</a> apparently have no particular job; I see them gadding about every mid-day and every afternoon. Of course, if I had anything to do myself, then I wouldn&#8217;t be out to see my neighbors, but that&#8217;s not the point of this blog entry. The point is that these obviously unemployed people &#8212; unkempt, nappy-haired, filthy-clothed, pockmarked, hollow-cheeked, pinpointed pupils &#8212; have a lot more going on, cash flow-wise, than I had expected. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003334.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Oh Transgendered Individual at Baja Fresh...</h3>
							<p class="date">May 16, 2007 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_sightings.html">Sightings</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I applaud you getting out there and not being shy in the middle of your transformation. And, heck, you&#8217;re looking pretty good! You&#8217;ve got great legs, and, let me say, I really want to give you props for the breasts you&#8217;ve chosen. A lot of guys would&#8217;ve gone big, but you picked some that are rather small and very tasteful on your athletic frame. Very soon, you&#8217;re going to look pretty good for a 50-some-year-old woman.<br />

							<h3>In Which My Faith In Humanity is Renewed</h3>
							<p class="date">Dec  7, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_sightings.html">Sightings</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I live in a moderately rough part of town. This is intentional; in <span class="caps">LA, </span>you can find great apartment values in neighborhoods that may look a bit &#8220;transitional&#8221; but in fact be perfectly safe. My &#8216;hood, although safe, is filled with both actual gangbangers and those who look like &#8216;bangers. Every day as I walk to get lunch, I see Latinos in white wife-beaters and baggy jeans, or African-Americans wearing red. Today, walking back from the store, I saw three such worthies, tall, big, African-American; one was wearing a <a href="http://www.blackstarvideo.com/videos2/Stop-Snitching.html">Stop Snitchin&#8217;</a> t-shirt. As I walked past, the tallest one said &#8220;hey, &#8216;scuse me, yo!&#8221; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002975.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Men Wearing The Wrong Collars Make Me Sad</h3>
							<p class="date">May  3, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_sightings.html">Sightings</a></p>
						    	
							<p>It seems that gentlemen these days are fond of the tie-with-button-down-collar look, which, I suppose, is a wonderful idea if you really like your collar to poof out, exposing the parts of the tie that wrap around your neck inside the collar. Me, I prefer to restrict the visible parts of my tie to a reasonably competent knot and the wide end, hanging down to the middle of my belt. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002567.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Actual Product Proposal During My Marketing Strategy Course</h3>

							<p>One of my classmates proposed, in all seriousness, that iPods be attached to insulin pumps so that diabetics could listen to music while they got their sugar under control. <span class="caps">I&#8230; </span><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002507.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Smells Like Poo!</h3>
							<p class="date">Apr 15, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_sightings.html">Sightings</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I went downtown with the Art Society of Marshall today, on a tour of <a href="http://www.laconservancy.org/tours/tours_main.php4#broadway">the LA skyline</a>. We were accompanied, on the early part of our tour, by an escort of downtown&#8217;s finest; that is to say, an African-American homeless man pushing a shopping cart full of flattened cardboard boxes. This worthy was clearly trying to inform us of some of the more subtle things around us: &#8220;smells like poo!&#8221; he&#8217;d yell, at the top of his lungs. &#8220;Smells like poo?&#8221; &#8220;SMELLS like poo!&#8221; The inflection varied between outbursts, almost as if he was trying to say different things (just like Junior can mean three different things when he says &#8220;hello!&#8221;). <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002491.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>The Shyest Tagger</h3>
							<p class="date">Apr  8, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_sightings.html">Sightings</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Walking to the store, I saw a tall, nervous man, wearing a baby-blue North Carolina baseball cap, ambling along, looking furtively from side to side. Near the Halal Carneceria, he stopped and, turning around in a couple of little circles, took in everything on the block. Then he sidled up to the water vending machine, leaned against it all cool-like for a second, and slinked in behind it. As I walked past and down to Venice, I could barely see the tall man, he was pressed so close to the water machine. What was he doing? <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002479.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>In my professor&#8217;s lecture. She&#8217;s a batty Britisher, smart as all get-out but a bit flaky. Her classes are nutty but informative. The best part wasn&#8217;t, however, that she used&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002454.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Undergrad Women Riding Bicycles</h3>
							<p class="date">Mar 23, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_sightings.html">Sightings</a></p>
						    	
							<p>As much as I appreciate the sight, undergrad women at <span class="caps">USC </span>&#8212; all of whom apparently have to meet a minimum standard of attractiveness to be admitted &#8212; probably shouldn&#8217;t&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002434.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Sighted In PS1 at USC</h3>
							<p class="date">Feb 22, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_sightings.html">Sightings</a></p>
						    	
							<p>One blonde freshman, in a white sweatshirt, in a white Corrolla, with the windows rolled up, teasing her eyelashes with a little round brush while looking in the lighted visor&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002316.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
