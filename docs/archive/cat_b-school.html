							<p>I should&#8217;ve known when I missed the first turn to the <a href="https://mymarshall.usc.edu/mems/user/registerEvent.jsp?activity=getEventById&amp;eventId=1053">Marshall Alumni Holiday Reception</a> and my next four chances to turn around were blocked off by <span class="caps">LAPD </span>auto and bike officers that things did not look good. But I drove around the northern half of Downtown and finally managed to get headed in the right direction to park and head into the event.<br />

I&#8217;m officially an <span class="caps">MBA.</span> I think the description for what I&#8217;m feeling now is &#8220;bittersweet, elated terror.&#8221; I definitely feel as if I&#8217;ve accomplished something incredible, but, gosh, the pressure to now accomplish something even more incredible is that much greater. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002600.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I spent the last two days thinking that if I just worked reeeally hard this semester, I could manange to graduate with some kind of honors or something. Now, this will shock those of you who know me, but I had actually made a <em>mathematical error</em> when computing my <span class="caps">GPA </span>and had myself at a 3.56, rather than the actual 3.48 <span class="caps">GPA </span>that I earned with all of my hard work etc. etc. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002539.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>If you&#8217;re interested in classifying yourself &#8212; and goodness knows, I classify everything so such an exercise certainly appeals to me &#8212; a good place to start might be the <a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes1.htm">Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</a>, a scientifically un-validated test that classifies everyone into one of 16 groups with four-letter names. I&#8217;m an <span class="caps">INTJ</span>; every time I&#8217;ve taken the <span class="caps">MBTI </span>&#8212; whether a fake version online I found in college or the real, authorized one I took in b-school or the several in between &#8212; I&#8217;ve come out an <span class="caps">INTJ.</span> But I took this other test for a class, the <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/j/5/j5j/IPIP/"><span class="caps">IPIP</span>-NEO</a>, and, well, the overlap between the two makes it clear that I&#8217;m in that little box formerly labeled <a href="http://www.biercephile.com/">Misanthrope</a>. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002235.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<h3>Things I Learned At The Marshall Halloween Party</h3>
							<p class="date">Oct 29, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Life is a series of lessons, often painful and traumatic. It&#8217;s at times like these that we need to write down the lessons we learn so that we don&#8217;t have to undergo these trials again. Simple, clear lessons can often be distilled from life&#8217;s most awful experiences, and set down, for review as we all strive and grow.</p>

<p>Of course, sometimes those lessons come from alcohol, friends, and excessively loud music. Then they&#8217;re just fun. Here&#8217;s what I learned at the Marshall Halloween party. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002011.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I thought it might be important for you, the two members of my reading public, that I post before I die of what may in fact be the Deadly Avian Flu (certainly, I am regularly exposed to a bird).</p>

<p>Actually, this is a pretty miserable thing I&#8217;ve got, whatever it is. Congestion, fever, aches &#8212; sounds like a flu of some sort. I can&#8217;t believe it so early in the year, I&#8217;m usually one of the last people to get the flu. While everyone is getting sick in November and December, I typically last &#8216;til February or even April, when people just think I&#8217;m making up this whole &#8220;flu&#8221; thing.  <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001953.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>One of the things we do a billion of here in b-school is <a href="http://cleverbird.com/wiki/InformationalInterviews/InformationalInterviews">informational interviews</a>.  The goals of these interviews are typically to learn which skills we need to broadcast in order to get into an industry, as well as make a contact in the industry who can later point us to jobs. I always try to tack on to that a few questions about how I can get the most out of the remainder of my <span class="caps">MBA </span>education. The guy I was speaking with on Wednesday had what I&#8217;ve come to realize is an excellent insight: there&#8217;s not enough time in an <span class="caps">MBA </span>to learn everything you&#8217;d like, but that first class in an area outside of your concentration will give you a lot more learning than that fifth class inside your concentration. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001940.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Tarred With The One Brush</h3>
							<p class="date">Oct  4, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Something sometimes happens in b-school, something that scares me as someone who&#8217;s seen it from the outside. In b-school, there&#8217;s group projects in every class; and, every now and then, there&#8217;s a group member who doesn&#8217;t contribute. News of this individual&#8217;s worthlessness in a group spreads quickly, and, soon, if you mention that person&#8217;s in your team, you get snickers from other hard-working people. Soon, wherever you go, that person is known as a Bad Team Member. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001926.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Working Hard or Hardly Working?</h3>

							<p>So this morning I wrote a 10-page paper. This is either a sign that I&#8217;m working really hard or that I&#8217;m a total slacker who puts big projects off &#8216;til the last minute. Since I&#8217;m finding time to blog right now, one might be inclined to pick the latter.</p>

<p>Anyway, this brings up the big question of the second year, which is: &#8220;do I work hard and learn a shitload and get out in the world ready to take on any challenge, or do I take the easiest classes I can find and try to get out of here with as much of my sanity intact as possible, given that I get the same three letters after my name either way and Marshall doesn&#8217;t report <span class="caps">GPA</span>s to potential employers?&#8221; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001894.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

Fortunately it only lasted a day and a half (as compared to up to a week for other people), but, as soon as I felt better, I went out for <em>churrascaria</em> and several caipirhinas, and that was pushing it too hard; the flu turned into a stomach thing that laid me up for most of another day.

							<p>Santiago is very European town; it could pass for a French or Spanish city, with parts of historical beauty and parts of awful &#8217;80s architecture and parts of deteriorating &#8217;50s concrete buildings. The people are also very European, with only, apparently, the road workers and cooks showing much Indian ethnic background. This makes for a very different feel than most of Latin America &#8212; especially Mexico, to which I&#8217;m somewhat used &#8212; and it means that Santiago mostly lacks the &#8220;exotic&#8221; women I typically go for. Also, it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m all that, but I&#8217;m kind of used to the Mexican women checking me out. In fact, I&#8217;ve been hit on even in front of the Wonderful Girlfriend. Maybe it&#8217;s the camera around my neck, or the little memo pad in which I take notes, or the not-in-style clothes, but the women in Santiago won&#8217;t even make eye contact. Apart from that, this town is a ton of fun. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001506.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>In a much-touted event, former GE <span class="caps">CEO</span> Jack Welch spoke at the Marshall School today to pitch his new book, <em>Winning</em>, and, since I <span class="caps">RSVP</span>d for a ticket immediately I actually got to get into the event and look at the back of someone&#8217;s head while listening to Welch talk for two hours (Jason, you have exactly five gray hairs). Actually, it was a really incredible speech and I was very impressed by Jack Welch&#8217;s clear, straightforward style and his blunt (although non-offensive) honesty. A good role model for us all and a lot of great food for thought.

							<p>The way you get into electives here at Marshall is to bid on the courses you want. We get 1000 points, a list of the classes that will be offered in the fall, a prospective list of spring classes, and a list of the last 3-4 years of waitlists for classes, then we get to bid our points on the classes we want. The theory is, this procedure makes sure that people get into the classes they value the most; but that ignores all the things besides desire that go into a bid. Which made me ask: what, exactly, is it that bidding on classes measures? <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001428.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>After a week and a half of pretty intensive review, I&#8217;ve managed to get my math scores up quite a bit. I&#8217;m making fewer mistakes and I&#8217;m more often choosing quick approaches to get problems solved in the least time possible. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000252.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Since the beginning of this process I&#8217;ve felt like I was behind. Most of the folks I know who have decided to go to business school were learning about getting their <span class="caps">MBA </span>for a year or more before their applications became due; I only decided to embark upon this journey two months ago. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000238.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>GMAT, Episode 3: Movin' On Up</h3>

							<p>After a solid week of practice, I&#8217;ve moved from getting the medium-level questions on my practice <span class="caps">GMAT </span>to getting hard questions. This is good, because the harder the questions you get (at least on the computer-adaptive test), the higher the score you&#8217;re eligible to get. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000234.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>When I was preparing to take the <span class="caps">SAT, </span>one of the most important things I learned from my Princeton Review prep book was how to spot the trick questions and answers in that test. My Princeton Review <span class="caps">GMAT </span>prep book is doing the same thing, and I think it will be very helpful. With many of the wrong answers in the test designed to look &#8220;right&#8221;, it&#8217;s important to know how to spot these answers and stay away from them. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000232.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>For many years, I imagined that my next test would be the <span class="caps">GRE, </span>either in Poli Sci or Psychology, depending on whether I wanted to be a spook for the <span class="caps">CIA </span>or an industrial psychologist modeling workplace behavior. Well, it turns out I&#8217;m taking the <span class="caps">GMAT </span>instead. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000230.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>After leaving my Web design firm, I took a few months to really think about what I wanted to do next. Going to business school quite has filtered itself to the top of my list, and I&#8217;m very excited about the prospect. But the fact is, I&#8217;m behind. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000229.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
