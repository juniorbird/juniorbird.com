							<h3>In Which I Admit, With Great Guilt, My Apathy</h3>
							<p class="date">Aug 28, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_ye_olde_politicks.html">Ye Olde Politicks</a></p>
						    	
							<p>So I grew up in a part of the country where national politics was everyday news. All the Senators and Cabinet members and whatnot were just down the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore-Washington_Parkway">B-W Parkway</a> and their foibles were as likely to make the Maryland section of the paper as the National. And I absorbed it all &#8212; I had opinions on all the Secretaries, every Senator, the fitness of the overall Congressional delegation from each state, to say nothing of policy issues. But I didn&#8217;t watch Obama tonight. Sadly, I just don&#8217;t care.</p>

							<h3>How to Get Your Stuff Back From TSA Lost-and-Found in Los Angeles</h3>
							<p class="date">Aug 17, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_travel.html">Travel</a></p>
						    	
							<p>A couple of weeks ago I traveled to Dallas, and, due to some confusion<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003707.html#fn1">1</a></sup> managed to leave my keys at security. Life with only the backup set of keys is, how shall we say, <s>not worth living</s> moderately inconvenient. Getting my keys back was easy enough once I figured out what to do, but it&#8217;s not obvious. Here&#8217;s how to get your stuff back from the <span class="caps">TSA.</span><sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003707.html#fn2">2</a></sup> <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003707.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Hello Internet, Can You Tell Me Where the Dog Hid the Onion?</h3>
							<p class="date">Aug 14, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_will_somebody_please_explain_to_me.html">Will Somebody Please Explain To Me...</a></p>
						    	
							<p>The dog was acting quite proud earlier today. Since he had recently barked at some people walking past the house, I thought nothing of it; but then I noticed the empty bag of onions on the floor next to him. The bag of onions that, last I checked it, held a rather sizeable red onion. And the dog, looking so proud, seated right next to the empty bag. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003708.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
