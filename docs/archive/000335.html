				<p>For all its ubiquity, the Web is not the Internet&#8217;s killer app &#8212; e-mail is. Every day, more bytes of e-mail messages than bytes of html documents transit the net. Given how much most business rely on e-mail, it&#8217;s surprising how awful most e-mail clients are at organizing the daily stream of information that bombards users daily. <span class="caps">IBM </span>researchers have <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/remail/">fascinating ideas</a> about how to build a better e-mail client.</p>
				
				<p>I&#8217;ve been using e-mail since 1993. My first e-mail client was <a href="http://www.washington.edu/pine/overview/index.html">Pine</a>, a command-line mail browser run in a terminal window. It ran directly on the mail server, was therefore incredibly fast and I could set it up to use any text editor I liked to compose mail.  I still miss Pine (it&#8217;s still commonly used, often in combination with <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">Mutt</a> &#8212; I could install both of these applications on my PowerBook, under <span class="caps">OSX, </span>and may choose to do so yet).</p>

<p>Later on, my college began to offer remote <span class="caps">SMTP </span>and <span class="caps">POP </span>connectivity, so I switched to the old <a href="http://wp.netscape.com/download/archive/client_archive40x.html">Netscape Communicator</a>. I didn&#8217;t love the interface, but I did love that the amount of mail I could save was no longer limited by how much disk space I had left in my account on the server. I didn&#8217;t much care for the slow Communicator, so I switched to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/otherproducts/outlookexpress/outlookexpress.aspx?pid=outlookexpress">Outlook Express</a>. I liked <span class="caps">OE, </span>it was fast, easy-to-use and had a good address book.</p>

<p>At work, once I graduated, I used <a href="http://www.cesoft.com/products/qmpro.html">QuickMail</a>, which was light on most features. But this was the first time I really needed to organize e-mail, and QuickMail was pretty good at this. I could nest and color-code folders and even incoming e-mail, and I was pretty enchanted that the colors in my mail matched the colors of the file folders I used to organize my filing cabinet.</p>

<p>My next job was in a PC-centric office, so I needed to switch to a mail client that ran on a <span class="caps">PC.</span> I tried the cult favorite <a href="http://www.eudora.com/">Eudora</a> and hated it. Settings were hidden and, worst of all it was hard to organize my incoming e-mail. I missed, in particular, the color-coding that had made it so easy to spot important e-mails in QuickMail.</p>

<p>So I switched to <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/home/office.aspx?assetid=FX01085793">Outlook</a>. And I fell in love. Sure, I&#8217;d heard all of the negative things about security and stability, but I loved the full-featured address book, the integrated calendar, the task list. I still missed colors.</p>

<p>Working for myself, I switched back to a Mac. But I had new faith in Microsoft&#8217;s e-mail programs, so I tried <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/entouragex/entouragex.aspx?pid=entouragex">Entourage</a>. And that was the best ever. I could color-code everything, there were powerful filters that could move incoming e-mails to various folders automatically, and I could match e-mails to entries in my address book and items on my task list.</p>

<p>Then I upgraded to Mac OS X. Sadly, I lost Entourage. Apple&#8217;s built-in <a href="http://www.mac.com/1/iTour/index.html">Mail</a> was light on the filtering power and had an interface I hated, but it integrated with the new system-wide address book. Now I&#8217;m on <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/mailsmith/index.shtml">Mailsmith</a>, which has incredible filters, integration with the system address book, and color-coding. I&#8217;m happy, but not ecstatic.</p>

<p>What am I not thrilled about? Well, mostly the shortcoming the <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/remail/">aforementioned <span class="caps">IBM </span>researchers</a> talk about in their paper &#8212; no ability to visualize the relationship between mail messages, no ability to show and hide irrelevant messages, no ability to file messages in multiple places and no ability to relate e-mail to calendar events, contacts, etc. I&#8217;d be excited to try a product like ReMail.</p>

<p>E-mail becomes central to more people&#8217;s lives every day. A better client is badly needed. The Web shows us what a network that relates information even moderately well can do; if e-mail clients did a solid job of organizing and relating incoming messages, the value of the medium would be massively increased.</p>
