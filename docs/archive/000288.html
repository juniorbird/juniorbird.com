				<p>The quest is at its end. The odyssey is over. I&#8217;ve taken the <span class="caps">GMAT, </span>and it was, well, not so bad.</p>
				
				<p>The test environment was about what I had been prepared for, quiet and remarkably solitary for a testing center. Thanks to the practice tests, I knew exactly how the questions would look and how to approach them.</p>

<p>And yet I tanked it straight off. The computer-adaptive <span class="caps">GMAT </span>is, well, adaptive &#8212; the more questions you get right, the harder the questions get. It goes the other way, too &#8212; as you get questions wrong, the questions get easier. And, for the first seven math questions, each problem seemed easier than the last. Bad sign!</p>

<p>Somewhere along the way, things turned around, because about question 20 I started seeing problems harder than anything I&#8217;d practiced. From there on in, it was smooth sailing. The scariest part was at the end, where they asked me if I wanted to cancel the test or submit my scores. Of course I was planning to submit the scores, but I wondered how many people accidentally cancelled the test. If I hit cancel, would there be a confirmation screen? Would my test disappear forever? Would I have just lost four hours of my life?</p>

<p>When I submitted the test, I got my score back, and it was just about what I was looking for. My prep got me enough points with a reasonable amount of effort, and now I can move on to new parts of the application process. Task the next: getting my transcripts together.</p>
