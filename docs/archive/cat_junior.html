							<h3>An Unexpected End to the Story</h3>
							<p class="date">May  5, 2013 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_junior.html">Junior</a></p>
						    	
							<p>The namesake of this blog is an umbrella cockatoo named Junior. Junior picked me back in June of 1998, and we spent 15 years being best friends. But, when the&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/004215.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Often, when weâ€™re around the house and trying to make a decision, we ask ourselves: who is the one around here we should be listening to? Who, really, is the&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/004071.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>There&#8217;s something to be said for having a pet who can talk. At the very least, it makes life a little bit exciting. New words are always fun, but so&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/004059.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Birds, in case you were wondering, are kind of like two-year-olds: they get obsessed with the new words they learn, and they should probably be wearing diapers. Junior has learned&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/004022.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>It finally happened. After years, somebody finally felt it was time to put an end to the behavior. So in came the professional, and the law got laid down. It was pretty much exactly like this:</p>

							<h3>What Do Pets Do at Night?</h3>

							<p>The <span class="caps">AIG </span>has this wonderful little dog &#8212; let&#8217;s call him Seamus. Seamus is pretty much Perfect Dog &#8212; friendly, respectful, cuddly, well-behaved, slobber-free, possessed of incredible bladder control &#8212; but he&#8217;s also got these soulful eyes. And, if he has one weakness, it&#8217;s his stinginess with kisses. So, when he woke us with kisses this morning, and deep, downcast brown eyes, the question was: what happened to the poor thing last night&#8217;s treats and cozy climbing under the covers and this morning&#8217;s plaintive paean for approval? <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003525.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Good Morning!</h3>

							<p>Let the official record show, today Junior said a new word. He said it clearly, loudly, and proudly, and I do think I&#8217;ll hear it again! I got out of bed, uncovered his cage, walked out of my bedroom and was called back with a boisterous &#8220;good morning!&#8221; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003406.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I&#8217;m a good bird; I like to talk nice, using sweet words and saying them in a sweet voice. That gets me love and kisses! And what bird doesn&#8217;t want love and kisses? But some days talking sweet just doesn&#8217;t work. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003256.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>This site&#8217;s namesake is pretty darned cute. Here&#8217;s Junior playing, set to the soundtrack of the audio from <a href="http://www.courttv.com/onair/shows/most_shocking/">Most Shocking</a>, which I might not choose to have on for the next one of these super-cute clips. Also, I think I need to work on the lighting.

							<p>My dad&#8217;s screwing up my habits. I like sitting on my tree, grooming myself, then climb down to sit down on his lap while he sits on the couch. For two years, I&#8217;ve been able to cilmb to the low branch on my tree, tell him what a pretty bird I am, and get armpit scratchies from my dad, then climb down onto the couch and my dad&#8217;s lap and get kisses and scratches on the top of my wing. That&#8217;s just how I like it. But lately, he&#8217;s been sitting on the chair on the other side of my tree, and I don&#8217;t know how to get scratchies from him there! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002929.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Nobody Consulted the Interspecies Council on This Daylight Savings Time Thing</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov  1, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_junior.html">Junior</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Okay, so it&#8217;s Fall Back time; we all get an extra hour of sleep Sunday morning, and now we get to enjoy the cold, still dark that comes in winter evenings. Well, we could if we didn&#8217;t live in Southern California. But I digress. Birds, now, birds know nothing of these Daylight Savings Time changes. All they do know is that sometimes they&#8217;re tired and testy, and sometimes they&#8217;re ready to eat breakfast and get the day started.<br />

							<h3>Junior's Man-Crush</h3>
							<p class="date">May 28, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_junior.html">Junior</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Junior has a new best friend, a new person whom he seems to love more than all others. When I <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002623.php">had to leave town</a> recently, Rick &#8212; who used to own parrots &#8212; took care of Junior. Ever since, Junior has been madly in love. Junior sits in his cage staring out the window, waiting for Rick to walk past, to his bike or garage; then, when Rick&#8217;s out there, Junior starts talking sweetly and then yelling &#8220;hello!&#8221; to his new friend outside the window. Yes, Junior&#8217;s head over heels. Fortunately, Rick seems to like him back. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002640.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I was going to go shooting with a friend this week, but I&#8217;ve been swamped by administrativa. Still, between that plan and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harlykwin714/133078791/">Amy&#8217;s new hardware</a>, I had to get some practice in. Specifically, I had to better understand the exposure and color performance of <a href="http://amazon.com/o/ASIN/B000A7JKTA/wadearmstrong-20/ref=nosim/">my camera</a>. For a project like that, I needed a subject that had bright whites as well as dark details. Hmm, it occurred to me, I have one of those sitting next to me! So, without further ado, here&#8217;s my best buddy, Junior Bird. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002588.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Attack of the Killer Cockatoo of Death</h3>

							<p>Junior may have finally done it; he&#8217;s always been (like any cockatoo) a bit of a destroyer of precious posessions, but he may have finally destroyed the one thing I love more than him.

							<p>Hello! How are you? I&#8217;m a pretty bird! Whatcha doin&#8217;? Today I got groomed! I wasn&#8217;t planning on it &#8212; I was going to sit on my boing and arrange my feathers precisely, put my plastic toys in my water (so they soften up and I can destroy them), then drag my wooden toys along the bottom of my cage to make that loud noise. Fun, huh? <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001844.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Remembrance of Parrots Past</h3>
							<p class="date">Jun 20, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_junior.html">Junior</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I finally saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424565/">The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill</a> this weekend. The parrots were portrayed as true individuals something which everybody who has been around parrots knows parrots are &#8212; even birds unsuitable for pets, like the conures in the movie. These birds, with their expressive body language and their social and bratty behavior, had a true love for interaction and a real relationship with people. Memories of parrots I&#8217;d once known filled me from the first moment of the movie to long after it was over. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001584.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
