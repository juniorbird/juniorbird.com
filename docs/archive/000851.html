				<p>There&#8217;s two minutes to go, the evil Colts have the ball, and my only hope for a win is that the Vikings&#8217; tight end Jermaine Wiggins scores two touchdowns. My fantasy Fantasy season has turned into a weekly sob story.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not that I drafted badly; and given that I only had five minutes to prepare for my draft, that&#8217;s quite a surprise. It&#8217;s that I bench the wrong players. After a four-game winning streak, I&#8217;ve now lost five in a row. Four out of those five games, including this week&#8217;s, I&#8217;ve had enough points to win sitting on the bench. And it&#8217;s not the same person on the bench either; This week I would have won had I started Jake Plummer over Tom Brady, but, three weeks ago, I lost by starting Plummer over Brady. I lost one game because I thought Quentin Griffin would pull out one last start before giving over to Reuben Droughns.</p>

<p>This week, I really thought I could win it. After two weeks I finally had Jamal Lewis back. I finally had a reliable tight end. I finally actually had three working wide recievers. And it turned out well! I&#8217;ve got the second-highest point total for the week in my league and I think that&#8217;ll keep through the night. Sadly, I managed to go up against the guy with the highest point total for the week.</p>

<p>Next week had been a gimme, against a guy who was 1-6 but lately he&#8217;s turned that into 3-6 and is looking strong. Sadly I&#8217;ve got some key players off next week so, since he&#8217;s turned it around, I&#8217;m almost guaranteed to lose next week, bringing me to 4-6. Can I run the table to make it to the playoffs? Probably not.</p>

<p>How do I pick better starters? Could I have had a more sure thing than Jake Plummer vs. the Bengals? Tom Brady vs. the Rams&#8217; non-existent secondary? Should I have not benched Plummer vs. the Falcons&#8217; (then) league-leading pass defense? The answer is clear: sure things suck. You don&#8217;t win with sure things. And that&#8217;s how I drafted, too, so I should know this lesson already. I drafted for the players&#8217; upside, which is how I ended up with Terrell Owens, Jamal Lewis, Quentin Griffin, and Reuben Droughns. And, yes, how I ended up with the suddenly ultra-productive Plummer. I need to play that way every week. I&#8217;ve been playing to minimize variance, which has led to me starting ol&#8217; reliable Tom Brady when I should have been taking a chance on Plummer or Brees. So there&#8217;s the answer: variance up, risk up, rewards up. Let&#8217;s see where it takes me.</p>

<p>And next year it&#8217;s all about Excel and statistical models anyway.</p>
