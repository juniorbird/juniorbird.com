				<p>What is the chance that DJ L&#8217;il Bit would hit the post button twice in a row? Apparently 100%. Anyway she - who has a Master&#8217;s in Screen and TV writing from <span class="caps">USC </span>- says that every story comes in three acts anyway, so that makes this kind of appropriate, anyway. Hmmmm, maybe I should study story structure.</p><p>Anyway, now we&#8217;re on to the dancing bits. I&#8217;m not sure I go to the Academy Awards for the dancing.</p><p>All the girls said &#8220;oooo&#8221; for Bradley Cooper. Everyone alway says he&#8217;ll be the next big star. But he keeps getting upstaged.</p><p>Wow, all those documentaries look incredible. I should watch more documentaries.</p><p>Terrifying temporary DirecTV outage! But it&#8217;s back. Is this what it&#8217;s like to live in New York?</p><p>Further proof that the Snuggie&#8217;s cool. Thanks, Tyler Perry!</p><p>Pedro Almod√≥var and Quentin Tarantino: puttin all the anti-establishment wacky ones in one place at one time, huh? And announcing the foreign language films&#8230; You&#8217;re not fooling me, Academy.</p><p>Poor Argentine guy, trying to keep up in his second or third language.</p><p>I know Avatar&#8217;s the favorite to win, but that excerpt didn&#8217;t make me want to watch it. I am thoroughly bored by the concept of the movie.</p><p>Wow, to best actor now? Awesome.</p><p>Wow, Michelle Pfeiffer just warmed Jeff Bridges&#8217;s heart.</p><p>George Clooney&#8217;s girlfriend: jealous!</p><p>Nobody loves anybody the way Michelle loves Jeff, eh?</p><p>How did Jeremy Renner have a 20-year career? Did he start in utero? I need to follow his skin-care regimen.</p><p>I don&#8217;t know why Jeff wasn&#8217;t nominated or The Men Who Stare At Goats, he was tons of fun there. In fact, he played the guy who&#8217;s giving this speech right now.</p><p>Good insight from another guest here: Jeff Bridges and his wife have the same hair!</p><p>Apple is selling the heck out of the iPad here. Nobody in the room wants one. (I don&#8217;t think anyone in the room is in the target demo.) Apple fail: the iPhone  autocorrect doesn&#8217;t know the name of the iPad.</p><p>Best Actress smackdown: Meryl Streep and Helen Mirren are sure winners. Who takes this one?</p><p>OH <span class="caps">SURE, GABOUREY SIDIBE GETS OPRAH</span> TO <span class="caps">ANNOUNCE HER.</span> Somebody has <em>already</em> won.</p><p>What is Sean Penn talking about? Didn&#8217;t somebody script this bit?</p><p>Again: if, a few years ago somebody told you that Sandra Bullock would even be <em>nominated</em> for an Oscar, you would&#8217;ve laughed. Awesome speech, too.</p><p><span class="caps">OK, </span>really, there&#8217;ve been no women or African-Americans who&#8217;ve won the Academy Award? Moviemaking needs a Rooney Rule.</p><p>I just want to say to Kathryn Bigelow, I was the one guy who bought the K-19 <span class="caps">DVD,</span> I really liked that movie.</p><p>What was that shake of the head, James Cameron? Jealous? Oh, well you are now that your ex-wife just beat you for most everything, eh?</p><p>I had the lead in points there for a minute. Just a minute. Now my score defines the line where somebody says &#8221; What&#8217;s the lowest score? Did anybody get less than [Wade&#8217;s score]?&#8221;</p><p><span class="caps">OK, </span>now there are a lot of movies I should see&#8230; I wouldn&#8217;t bet on that though. Despite the fact that movies just aren&#8217;t that important to me, this Oscar party was more fun than I&#8217;d expected. The whole show was more watchable than I&#8217;d expected. And blogging the whole time allowed me to easily avoid interacting with most people and, now, cleaning up. I guess I should pitch in. Or, at least, not stand in the middle of the kitchen.</p>
