				<p>I have food allergies. For the sake of simplicity, it&#8217;s easiest to say that I&#8217;m allergic to pretty much everything. If accuracy is a priority, then I&#8217;m specifically allergic to corn &#8212; whose byproducts are in most everything &#8212; and to cow&#8217;s milk, whose byproducts are in most everything else. For extra added bonus I&#8217;m also allergic to pineapple and dates. None of this fine food will kill me or anything crazy like that, it&#8217;ll just make me boring to hang out with, unless your idea of a good time is rifling through my stuff while I&#8217;m in the bathroom. So, for years, I&#8217;ve avoided anything that most of the readers of this blog would consider &#8220;food&#8221;. Or, at least, anything that most of the readers of this blog would consider &#8220;yay food!&#8221; But now, there may be hope &#8212; there may be something that we can do about my little excessive histamine response problem.</p>

<p>All the places I&#8217;ve traveled in the last few years have been in Latin America, and I speak pretty good Spanish and mediocre Portuguese, so I&#8217;ve been able to ask specifically, read labels, and ensure that I don&#8217;t consume milk or corn products (this is exceeding difficult in Mexico). But Thailand, Viet Nam, Cambodia &#8212; can&#8217;t speak none of that. In many cases, I won&#8217;t have any concept of what&#8217;s in the food that&#8217;s on the plate in front of me. So I went to my doctor, and, after a few minutes of back-and-forth, ended up with a prescription for <a href="http://www.drugs.com/pdr/Gastrocrom_Oral_Concentrate.html">Gastrocrom</a>:</p>

<p><img src="/images/gastrocrom/gastrocrom-box.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The drug itself comes in a big box, stuffed with foil envelopes containing the drug delivery system, an ampule:</p>

<p><img src="images/gastrocrom/gastrocrom-close.jpg" alt="" height="299" width="450" /></p>

<p>I break open an ampule and empty the clear liquid into a glass filled with water. Then I drink the water. Then I can eat anything I want. Seriously, I had a Papa John&#8217;s pizza and a coke earlier this week, which is pretty much the exacta of cow milk-based cheese and corn syrup. Normally, that would have given me an unpleasant evening and some challenges during the following morning &#8212; but my night and day were completely uneventful. Every day since has been the same. I can, ya know, eat just about anything. And I plan to take advantage of that brand-new fact on my vacation.</p>
