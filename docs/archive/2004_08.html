							<p>I&#8217;ve recently had the privelege of interacting with two vendors who had sold their goods to me: Dell and <span class="caps">PUR, </span>the water filter people.

							<p>One of the many small miracles I get to experience as a resident of the fine city of Los Angeles is the Handy J Car Wash, a venue offering unparalelled&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000700.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>One afternoon I made the &#8212; apparently fairly serious &#8212; error of hanging out in the courtyard at Popovich (the b-school building here).

							<p>Friday was our first case competition. First time we had to read about somebody&#8217;s business decision and develop an alternative and present that in front of a bunch of people&#8230;. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000684.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>My body has quite an extensive color palette going on right now. Starting at the bottom, we have: I got this lovely bruise from riding the mechanical bull at Union&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000681.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
