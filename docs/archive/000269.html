				<p>One of my friends is applying to law school, and to help this friend learn more about law school I tracked down several law school blogs. Reading these blogs piqued my interest in law school &#8212; why not, I asked myself, find good blogs that I can regularly read to better understand the b-school experience?</p>
				
				<p>With a little bit of Googling I was able to find a few dozen blogs kept up by current <span class="caps">MBA </span>candidates or b-school applicants. A few of these stood out; I realized they were:</p>


<ul>
<li>Insightful</li>
<li>Filled with good stories</li>
<li>Well-written</li>
<li>Amusing enough to read every few days</li>
</ul>



<p>This is a pretty high standard to hold a weblog to, and it tells me I&#8217;d better shape up with my writing here! So, first, a joke:</p>

<blockquote><p>A giraffe walks into a bar, pulls himself up a stool next to the door, sits down and asks the bartender for a shot of whiskey. The bartender looks at him funny and asks &#8220;So, just what are you?&#8221; The giraffe replies &#8220;I&#8217;m a giraffe, don&#8217;t you serve giraffes?&#8221; The bartender looks at his shoes for a minute, thinks  about it and allows that, well, nobody ever told him <strong>not</strong> to serve giraffes. So he slides a shot of whiskey down the bar to the giraffe. The giraffe throws the shot back and empties it in one quick swallow, looks sidelong at the bartender and passes out cold on the floor next to his stool. A guy walks into the bar and sees the giraffe laying across the entrance and asks the bartender &#8220;Hey, what&#8217;s this lyin&#8217; here?&#8221; Says the bartender: &#8220;That&#8217;s no lion, that&#8217;s a giraffe!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Didn&#8217;t you enjoy that? And now, the blogs that inspired the above:</p>
