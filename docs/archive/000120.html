				<p>Since I&#8217;ve been on this crazy diet I&#8217;ve had to buy almost all of my food at Whole Foods; the stuff at Ralph&#8217;s is all filled with additives and other crap. So, to some extent, I&#8217;m actually happy for the change &#8212; it&#8217;s good to know I&#8217;m not eating as much dextrose and guar gum and maltosymbulase, as well as the stuff that makes me sick.</p>

<p>Now, the reputation of Whole Foods is that it&#8217;s incredibly expensive &#8212; thus the nickname &#8220;Whole Paycheck.&#8221; But I&#8217;ve found a whole bunch of great and not-so-expensive items there that I&#8217;m totally addicted to.</p>

<p>The first, of course, is the vegetables. For both the organic and conventionally-grown items, they&#8217;re about the same price as at Ralph&#8217;s and much more attractive and tastier. The good price is nice, but paying just a little extra for the taste is well worth-it. And fresher produce lasts longer in the fridge. Just make sure to wash even the organic produce, there&#8217;s no insecticide on it but there&#8217;s usually plenty of the ladybugs that the farmers use to control pests.</p>

<p>The store brand, 365, is also quite affordable. The pasta sauce is just $1.99, is tasty, relatively low-fat and has no extra crap in it. The syrup and jam is all-natural and is as cheap as everything except for the very nastiest all-artificial Ralph&#8217;s brand stuff. The bread is great, nothing fancy in it but tasty and good and as little as $1.99 for a loaf. The meat is great &#8212; the Ralph&#8217;s has a meat section that&#8217;s, frankly, scary &#8212; the butchers knowledegeable, and the prices great, often as low as $1.99/lb for a whole chicken. </p>

<p>Oh, and then there&#8217;s my Wonderful Girlfriend&#8217;s favorite thing &#8212; the pizza crust. See, I found this 9&#34; pizza crust that&#8217;s only 1/2 gram of fat for 1/3 the crust. It&#8217;s made from rice flour, is thin and tasty (just don&#8217;t undercook it, it gets gummy). I love to put a little olive oil on the crust (from Nature&#8217;s Harmony), top it with some of that 365 pasta sauce, some fresh vegetables, some Yves brand no-fat vegan pepperoni, and one of a variety of goat&#8217;s milk cheese that they sell. Mmmm, she was addicted the first time she had a bite of this pizza, and you&#8217;ll be too!</p>
