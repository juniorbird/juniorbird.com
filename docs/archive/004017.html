				<p>This winter has been full of cold, wet weather. This kind of environment is unfamiliar in <span class="caps">LA, </span>a land of single-pane windows, minimal insulation, and even less drainage. Given my druthers, I&#8217;d solve all problems with either technology or cooking. While technology may soon enough solve cold and wet through global warming, in the short term the best solution is a cooking one: a hot bowl of soup. So this winter has been full of soups.<!-- more --></p><p>Beyond the weather, I was also inspired by a gift DJ L&#8217;il Bit gave me not this Christmas but the one before: a cookbook called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0811860329?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wadearmstrong-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0811860329" target="_blank">Sunday Soup</a>. This is a fun cookbook filled with practical, seasonal recipes, and I really recommend it. I&#8217;ve enjoyed making the soups in it and it&#8217;s also inspired me to find more recipes, in places like Epicurious and Food &amp; Wine.</p><h3>The Soups</h3><p>There&#8217;s our old standby, the <a href="http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Garlic-Soup-with-Poached-Eggs-15612" target="_blank">garlic soup with poached eggs</a>. This is a perennial favorite, made from slowly sautéed sliced garlic, simmered in beef broth, with a nice, thick slice of garlic bread and a couple of lightly poached eggs:<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juniorbird/4342690942/" title="Garlic Soup with Poached Eggs by juniorbird, on Flickr" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2530/4342690942_3c457e0019.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="Garlic Soup with Poached Eggs"/></a></p><p>There was a great Tuscan bean soup, with kale and spicy sausage. I used fresh rosemary instead of dried, since we have the bush in the back, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutabaga" target="_blank">rutabagas</a> instead of potatoes. Yes, that&#8217;s right, Rutabaga. Not just a fun word to say, Rutabagas are a great ingredient in soups and stews, if you love potatoes but are looking to cut down on your carbs. These purple-and-white root vegetables have the right texture and the right flavor, and you can treat them just the same way.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juniorbird/4341972091/" title="IMG_1171 by juniorbird, on Flickr" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4016/4341972091_d39d11d5c7.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_1171"/></a></p><p>There was an absolutely delicious beef barley soup. It was so good that I forgot to take a photo. I don&#8217;t care if the characters in <a href="http://www.cbs.com/primetime/the_mentalist/" target="_blank">The Mentalist</a> make fun of beef barley soup, it warms the bones and fills the stomach, and that&#8217;s what winter&#8217;s about.</p><p>And finally there was a cauliflower soup. I&#8217;ll be honest: this is the only one I took good pictures of the cooking process, so you get to see it in action. I know what you&#8217;re thinking, but this is a great soup that can stand on its own for dinner. And boy is cauliflower healthy for you.</p><p>First you start by sweating some leeks. Those French know their things, leeks help almost any soup<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juniorbird/4342700712/" title="IMG_1097 by juniorbird, on Flickr" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4034/4342700712_b7ea521eb0.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_1097"/></a></p><p>Next, chop up a head or two of cauliflower. The more the merrier!<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juniorbird/4342701642/" title="IMG_1105 by juniorbird, on Flickr" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4044/4342701642_b43182a091.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_1105"/></a></p><p>Cook that all together and puree in a blender or, if you like soup like we do, get yourself a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006G3JRO?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wadearmstrong-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0006G3JRO" target="_blank">stick blender</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wadearmstrong-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0006G3JRO" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/> and do the work in the pot you cooked everything in. It&#8217;s so much easier, this change alone has made me not fear making creamy soups.</p><p><span class="caps">OK, </span>this soup can&#8217;t be all healthy. First of all, add a little shredded cheese (I used a Gouda, and cut the amount from the recipe in half):<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juniorbird/4341963825/" title="IMG_1118 by juniorbird, on Flickr" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4052/4341963825_043e38d6c6.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_1118"/></a></p><p>And then sauté some cut-up prosciutto slices, until they become little meat chips (you don&#8217;t need to add much oil to do this, the rendering fat from the prosciutto will do the job for you).<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juniorbird/4341966787/" title="IMG_1131 by juniorbird, on Flickr" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2715/4341966787_9d1b5d6a08.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="IMG_1131"/></a></p><p>Stir in half the cheese; ladle the soup into bowls, sprinkle the prosciutto and some shredded cheese on top, and serve it forth:<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juniorbird/4342708920/" title="IMG_1142 by juniorbird, on Flickr" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2769/4342708920_d21b1eb058.jpg" width="333" height="500" alt="IMG_1142"/></a></p><p>It&#8217;s cold, it&#8217;s rainy, come on Angelenos, soup is just, um, super this winter. We sure love it, even the little black dog.</p>
