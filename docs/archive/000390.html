				<p>The Stern school at <span class="caps">NYU </span>invited me to interview. How could I possibly pass up a chance to visit the Big Apple and catch the tail end of winter? Plus, the phone interview was <a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/000383.html">right out</a>. So, last weekend, I flew clear across the country and girded myself to face New York.</p>
				
				<p>There were of course two sides to the trip &#8212; the visit to <span class="caps">NYU, </span>and the visit to New York itself. My trip started with some time spent with a good friend from college who now lives in Brooklyn and teaches high school in Hell&#8217;s Kitchen. We tooled around Manhattan all Sunday, then met for drinks Monday night after my interview. New York was windy and chilly; cars rushed at pedestrians at top speed; the subway was filled with construction and deviated from all its normal routes; and the occupants of said subway broke new ground in personal odors. I loved it.</p>

<p>I loved <span class="caps">NYU </span>too. I attended a Finance class taught by Aswath Damodaran, a professor of some renown; while some of the lesson referenced information I hadn&#8217;t been previously exposed to, it was altogether interesting and absorbing. I had a face-to-face interview, thank goodness, and felt much more at ease and that the interview was reasonably successful. I have some hope of getting in. </p>

<p>Were I admitted, I&#8217;d have a hard time choosing between Stern and <span class="caps">USC</span> Marshall. I enjoyed both schools and both seem like great places, although they&#8217;re quite different. My impression is that Stern is academically challenging and demands a great deal of the student&#8217;s time to complete schoolwork. Its environment is cooperative but not as warm as <span class="caps">USC&#8217;</span>s, which struck me as almost absurdly open and interactive. Marshall also appears to place more emphasis on networking and group activities outside of class, rather than traditional academic accomplishment. It&#8217;s much like the choice I had to make between the University of Chicago and Pomona College eleven years ago. Wonder if I&#8217;ll make the same choice again.</p>
