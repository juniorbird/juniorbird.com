				<p>I don&#8217;t see many movies these days. Sure, there are a bunch that look good &#8212; heck, even <em>Ghost Rider</em> has my girlfriend <a href="http://imstars.aufeminin.com/stars/fan/D20050516/1914_884147285_eva_mendes_018_H220502_L.jpg">Eva Mendes</a> in it &#8212; but I never seem to get around to seeing them. Not only are movies too expensive, but they&#8217;re in the the theaters for such a short time, and so many of them are complete crap. Expensive, hard-to-find crap is no good. So, the highest praise for a movie might be that it makes me want to see another, specific movie. On that scale, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0498380/">Letters From Iwo Jima</a> scores quite high &#8212; if <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418689/">Flags of Our Fathers</a>, which I had intentionally skipped seeing before, were still in theaters, I&#8217;d rush over to see it.</p>

<p><em>Letters from Iwo Jima</em> must have been, as everyone will point out, a challenging movie to make. It&#8217;s almost all in Japanese (a few, brief, scenes are in English). The heroes are all people who we fought against in World War II; the guys they kill are all American. The heroes must lose at the end of the movie. It&#8217;s not like you see this kind of thing on the big screen all the time; not only was there a need for high-quality execution, but even the conception of the movie must&#8217;ve been difficult.</p>

<p>The payoff was big. There were real, sympathetic Japanese characters &#8212; we understood what many were feeling and why. Of course, there were also unsympathetic characters, because the war was filled with reckless Japanese militarists who followed a perverse death cult, but at least these stereotypical characters were portrayed accurately. At any rate, it was easy to truly care for a number of the characters.</p>

<p>The plot moved well also. It steadily built to the invasion and tough island fighting, with each scene showing a higher level of strain than the last. We understood the fractured relationship between some of the characters, saw the strength of the island&#8217;s defenses grow, and then saw it all smashed by the Americans. My only complaint was that we really did not see a passage of time during the battle itself; most viewers would probably guess that the fighting lasted a few days, rather than the 35 it actually did. </p>

<p>In the end, <em>Letters From Iwo Jima</em> was a real movie, not just a movie in a foreign language. That shows a lot of skill. As real movies go, it was very much a war movie, which is fine, because who actually wants to see someone attempt another <em>Pearl Harbor</em>? Keeping this movie simple probably kept it good. Ken Watanabe deserves the recognition he&#8217;s getting in his leading role, Eastwood deserves his nomination for best director &#8212; heck, the cinematographer deserved his <span class="caps">CFCA </span>nomination.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to see more movies like this &#8212; small, targeted, efficient, effective, cheap, interesting, expanding. It seems like a good shtick. I suggest somebody script-ize <a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/030681157X/ref=nosim/wadearmstrong-20">Hell in a Very Small Place</a>. Heck, these days, you could shoot that on location too. In the meantime, I guess I have to go rent <em>Flags of our Fathers</em>.</p>
