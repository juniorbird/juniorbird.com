							<h3>What Do Pets Do at Night?</h3>

							<p>The <span class="caps">AIG </span>has this wonderful little dog &#8212; let&#8217;s call him Seamus. Seamus is pretty much Perfect Dog &#8212; friendly, respectful, cuddly, well-behaved, slobber-free, possessed of incredible bladder control &#8212; but he&#8217;s also got these soulful eyes. And, if he has one weakness, it&#8217;s his stinginess with kisses. So, when he woke us with kisses this morning, and deep, downcast brown eyes, the question was: what happened to the poor thing last night&#8217;s treats and cozy climbing under the covers and this morning&#8217;s plaintive paean for approval? <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003525.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Memorialize Yourself, In Lucite</h3>

							<p>When I graduated from business school, I of course got the photos from the official photographer of me walking up to the podium in my mortarboard and of me shaking hands with some muckety-muck. I mean, the hired photog gets all the best angles, so there&#8217;s no fighting it. Some things, however, there should be fighting. Some things are so awful, so in bad taste, that they threaten to infect an entire room with their evil. And the official photographer is trying to pitch just such a thing. I give you the lucite statue that could be me: <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003153.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Us Birds Like Our Accustomed Perches</h3>

							<p>My dad&#8217;s screwing up my habits. I like sitting on my tree, grooming myself, then climb down to sit down on his lap while he sits on the couch. For two years, I&#8217;ve been able to cilmb to the low branch on my tree, tell him what a pretty bird I am, and get armpit scratchies from my dad, then climb down onto the couch and my dad&#8217;s lap and get kisses and scratches on the top of my wing. That&#8217;s just how I like it. But lately, he&#8217;s been sitting on the chair on the other side of my tree, and I don&#8217;t know how to get scratchies from him there! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002929.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
