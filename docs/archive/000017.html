				<p>I had the weridest dream last night! Unexpected, new dream too.</p>

<p>I was in a college (but I wasn&#8217;t <em>in</em> college, see? It wasn&#8217;t my college. Maybe I came back to it? I think I was visiting a friend&#8217;s class&#8230;). I was in a class taught by a fairly young male professor, possibly a young version of the one from Good Will Hunting or possibly that guy from My Big Fat Greek Wedding and Northern Exposure. I&#8217;d brought Junior to class for some kind of show-and-tell (it was a discussion class, not a lecture class). We were all sitting in those desk-chairs in orderly rows in the blue-walled rooms, and I was showing Junior off to students. Junior had a bit of a plucking problem, much worse than the one he has in real life - his wings were bare and his sides too. Suddenly I could see that he had poop backed up inside him, all the way from his little butt to his neck! I had to take him to the vet, but I had to find the professor to get out of class. I looked in a lounge for him - it was a small lounge with a white microwave (in fact, I think it was my girlfriend&#8217;s white microwave) - and I looked for him in a blue bathroom with showers in the middle. No professor! Then I woke up and sat straight up.</p>

<p>What could it all mean?</p>
