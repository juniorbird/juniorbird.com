				<p>I&#8217;ve been exiled to the garage all weekend long. It&#8217;s because I did the worst thing a new father can do &#8212; I got sick. So here I am, stuck out behind the house, wearing a surgical mask, napping in a chair, hoping I don&#8217;t get anybody &#8212; especially my one-month-old &#8212; sick.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juniorbird/8525504990/" title="Me in my sick day surgical mask by juniorbird, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8244/8525504990_4ef76d5c0b.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Me in my sick day surgical mask" /></a></p><p>It all started Friday. I thought I woke up on the wrong side of the bed, but, as the day went on, I could feel it &#8212; fever, cough, general misery. I kept up a brave face at work and tried not to cough on my co-workers. All day, I thought: what will I do this weekend to avoid getting Declan sick? Do I get a hotel room? Do I wash my hands every five minutes?</p><p>I didn&#8217;t get a hotel room, but I did wash my hands every five minutes. I&#8217;ve spent my days in the garage and the nights in the guest room. It&#8217;s not so bad, since all I want to do is sleep. The problem is: all my poor wife wants to do is sleep too, but she&#8217;s got every feeding, every changing, every single thing until I&#8217;m well enough to be allowed to touch the baby. The best I can do is wash my hands, grab a paper towel, put on my surgical mask, and give Declan a pacifier he dropped. That&#8217;s not much parenting.</p><p>Unfortunately, there&#8217;s no heartwarming end to this post. Hopefully I&#8217;ll be well enough to start carrying my weight soon. I&#8217;m miserable now, which is sad; and I miss my son, whom I can only see through the monitor.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juniorbird/8524443211/" title="Through the baby monitor by juniorbird, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8517/8524443211_445c1f54ab.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Through the baby monitor" /></a></p>
