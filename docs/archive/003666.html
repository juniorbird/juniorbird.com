				<p>Thank you for coming so early this year. I really appreciate how you gave me the old get-up-and-go by taking away an hour of my wasted sleep time last Sunday, and how you  bring light to the evening hours. Those energy savings would sure be nice, too.</p>

<p>I really have to give you credit for how you make <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=krav+maga&amp;search=Search">Krav Maga</a> seem more like work than like fun, what with ensuring that I get up in the dark to make the 7am class to start my day. I was sure getting spoiled with those sunny mornings that we had just last week, all warm enough that I didn&#8217;t need to bundle up in my hoodie on the drive there and all. Yep, it&#8217;s good to be reminded that fitness requires sacrifices, especially if you want guns like mine.</p>

<p>Still, <a href="http://www.shns.com/shns/g_index2.cfm?action=detail&amp;pk=SMARTSHOPPER-03-11-08">one might ask</a> why we need more light in the evening &#8212; when it&#8217;s nice being cozy inside &#8212; than we do in the morning &#8212; when we&#8217;re supposed to get up and get going. And, most of us rely on artificial lighting anyway, what with the small West Coast windows,  so who cares about daylight?</p>

<p>In fact, what with the concerns that many have that Daylight Savings time doesn&#8217;t actually save energy, and the increase in traffic and industrial accidents occasioned by taking away a precious hour of sleep from our under-rested populace, I might suggest that you oughtn&#8217;t come at all. But that&#8217;s just a suggestion. It could be crazy<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003666.html#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>No, Daylight Savings Time, I should appreciate you, because you give us an excuse, for two precious days a year, to miss any arranged event, be it doctor&#8217;s appointment, wedding, or business meeting. Thank you, Daylight Savings Time, for giving me a computer update, and the chance to change every clock in the apartment, for two glorious days every year.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Like the suggestion that, instead of wasting all of our money on things like <span class="caps">HIV </span>prevention and sending a man to the moon and green energy and replacing decaying infrastructure, we instead devote our national wealth to building a massive machine that changes the rotation of the planet so that we, in fact, save our daylight for the weekends, when we can all play, and spend our nighttime during the week, when we&#8217;re all locked in offices anyway. Now, that&#8217;s just plain crazy.</p>
