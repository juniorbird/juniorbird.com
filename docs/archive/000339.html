				<p>Sundays are good days to have something out-of-the-ordinary for breakfast. It&#8217;s impossible to be too motivated to work on the last day of rest, football is on the <span class="caps">TV, </span>and, having slept in, brunch makes almost as much sense as cereal. I like to make Iron Chef brunches &#8212; see what&#8217;s in the fridge and concoct something that&#8217;s just slightly breakfast-y out of it.</p>
				
				<p>This weekend&#8217;s leftovers were some sheep&#8217;  milk blue cheese and a leftover organic tomato. I&#8217;ve been having tomato problems for a few weeks now &#8212; for two or three recipes in a row I&#8217;ve put in one less tomato than I&#8217;ve bought. Not for any reason, now; it&#8217;s just because I forget. I think it has something to do with the fact that I hate cutting tomatoes (perhaps I should invest in a food mill). This morning I opened the refrigerator door and saw an opportunity to get rid of that extra tomato!</p>

<p>The cheese is a different story. I discovered earlier this year that I&#8217;m allergic to cow&#8217;s milk, so my relationship with cheese has entirely changed. I can have all other kinds of milk, but that does rule out pretty much everything in your grocery&#8217;s deli case. I have to slice my own lunch cheese and shred my own pizza cheese. And the cheeses I have to work with? Well, no American Fare In A Bag for me; only actual made-with-skill-and-care small-market goat&#8217;s and sheep&#8217;s milk cheeses. I always loved cheese, but now I love it even more, because it&#8217;s no longer just nice, it&#8217;s <em>good</em>. This blue cheese was a nice, stinky, sweet and mild cheese that just begged to be melt.</p>

<p>So melt it I did. Put cheese on sliced tomato, stick under toaster oven&#8217;s broiler for a few minutes &#8212; that&#8217;s brunch! Serve with a side of applesauce and some OJ to get your day started out right!</p>
