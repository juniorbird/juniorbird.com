				<p>I was re-packing Declan&#8217;s diaper bag yesterday and out came a little packet of gauze and vaseline we&#8217;d put in there, for properly wrapping his new circumcision when changing his diapers. It took just a few days for his circumcision to heal up after we got home, and we&#8217;ve long since stopped with the vaseline and gauze, which I suppose is good because putting those two words together in print is so creepy.</p><p>When we saw the gauze and vaseline we both teared up a little, thinking of our days-old boy home fresh from the hospital, and how much things had changed since then. And he&#8217;s only three weeks and a day old! Just a couple of days ago the last of his umbilical cord fell off, and now we&#8217;ll never see him with a cord again.</p><p>My friends all told me: enjoy your son&#8217;s every moment, because everything will fly by. I believed them, but I also thought: isn&#8217;t that the kind of nostalgia that waits until your child is a verbal, interactive toddler? My doubt has been proven wrong; these tired, long, late, loud days also are filled with a joyous padding of moments we&#8217;ll treasure. It&#8217;s amazing, and it&#8217;s amazing how far we&#8217;ve come already.</p>
