				<p>I have no idea exactly how to describe this, but I seem to be craving tannins lately. <span class="caps">OK,</span> I take that back, I know exactly how to describe it: I&#8217;ve been craving tannings lately; I&#8217;m more confused as to what the heck is going on. Who needs bitter flavors with an astringent feel on the tongue? But I can&#8217;t stop drinking tea and cheap, young red wine.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a cost-effective jones, as these things go &#8212; tea&#8217;s mostly hot water anyway &#8212; but sometimes that $6 bottle of wine does go wrong. I got tannins aplenty with a cheap bottle of some grape I&#8217;d never even heard of last week &#8212; the wine could best have been described as &#8220;aggressive,&#8221; and wasn&#8217;t entirely undrinkable, just too strong to taste what I was trying to eat. The new bottle of wine that my neighbor left here, half-empty, is going down well enough tonight, though.</p>

<p>There have been other cravings before, weird ones. When I got back from <a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/200720">Southeast Asia</a> I wanted everything <a href="http://www.recipesource.com/ethnic/asia/vietnamese/00/rec0039.html">fermented</a> &#8212; a craving well-enough handled with some store-bought <em>nam pla</em> and powdered dried shrimp. Granted, you could smell my cooking a block away, but it made people happy. There was also a tamarind phase, but, let&#8217;s face it, you can get <a href="http://www.novamex.com/jarritos.sstg">tamarind soda</a> all over this town.</p>

<p>Perhaps I should try a more normal craving, like chocolate or pickles. Chocolate, at least, would be popular, and there&#8217;s quite the variety of gourmet and even milk-free options for me to choose from. Pickles are a more typical jones, and actually one I had a few years ago; then it was for the sweet chips that we <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Baltimoron">Baltimorons</a> tend to eat like potato chips. Can&#8217;t get good enough ones of those out here.</p>

<p>What crazy, irresistible food urge is next? <a href="http://www.utzsnacks.com/products/regchips.html">Crab chips</a>? Butter? Sausage? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hufu">Hufu</a>? The mind boggles.</p>
