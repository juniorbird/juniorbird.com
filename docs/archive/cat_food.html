							<p>First, let&#8217;s get one thing straight: I&#8217;m a bad Jew.

							<p>I love Scotch. This is fortunate, since I pretty much can’t drink any other kind of whiskey. It’s that corn allergy thing — only a nice single malt Scotch is&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/004039.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<h3>Official 2009 Holiday Kitchen Buyer's Guide</h3>

							<p>I like to cook. You may have <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_food.html">read</a>. Any chef loves their gadgets, and, being a geek, I do so more than most. While I do tend to think that the solution to almost any problem is technology, I don&#8217;t like to keep things around that don&#8217;t really, really work. Since it&#8217;s the holiday season, and that means getting stuff for both of the major world religions of which I am a member, here are a few such gadgets I suggest you put on your wish list this year. For your online shopping convenience, I&#8217;ve included links to buy all these goodies at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F&amp;tag=wadearmstrong-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Amazon</a>, which incidentally gives a smidge of the price of your purchase to me, at no cost to you. I&#8217;ve also tried to pick reasonably-priced entry-level options, for particular holiday season. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003877.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>And I Am Become Old</h3>

							<p>Growing up, we were always big on the family meal. Breakfast was in a nook behind our kitchen, at a yellow and white Formica table that just fit in the corner next to the basement stairs. When I was young, I would read the cereal boxes while my parents read their newspapers; I learned every ingredient and every serving suggestion and solved every puzzle on the back. While we weren&#8217;t a sugary-cereal household, my mom and I did have our own breakfast indulgence: back in the days before most people used skim milk, we&#8217;d pour whole milk on our cereal and then top it off with some half-and-half. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003820.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Salmon with Asian Pesto</h3>

							<p>With all the <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003702.html">basil from the housewarming party</a>, I could hardly resist making all manner of pesto. The Thai basil basically dared me to make an Asian-flavored pesto, and, once made, the perfect match was clearly a simple grilled salmon. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003758.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Peanutty Tofu & Cabbage Asian Salad</h3>

							<p>The summer just won&#8217;t quit here in Southern California, which means summery dishes even as the night comes sooner. A good Asian salad is a great weekend lunch or light weeknight dinner, and this recipe is pretty low-fat and responsible. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003759.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>One of the benefits of living in California is the year-round summer. That means every day is a great day for a Margarita, and, with a lemon tree in our backyard, that means homemade sour mix for those Margaritas! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003757.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Pizza&#8217;s great, and with all the great basil we got for our <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003702.html">housewarming</a>, a pizza with pesto replacing the marinara seemed obvious. The <span class="caps">AIG </span>also has this great, old, well-seasoned grill pan that we use for just about everything, so grilling the pizza sure sounded fun. Thus, super-adult, super-fun, grilled pesto flatbread! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003756.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Healthy cooking can be fun. So can unhealthy eating! Everybody loves a good lasagna, but that Italian delectable is filled with fat and calories and not exactly great for the &#8216;ol ticker. So we whipped up a meatless, cheeseless, low-carb, and otherwise trend-compliant version, semi only because we added a bit of Pecorino for some richness. It came out light and delicious! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003755.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Meal of the Month: Fricassee</h3>
							<p class="date">Feb 25, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_food.html">Food</a></p>
						    	
							<p>This Meal of the Month is quickly becoming a method-of-cooking of the month; but what&#8217;s more appealing than a general approach that works well? And, in the winter, what could be better than a delicious stew? The fricassee is a traditional French dish, the more haute cuisine version featuring chicken in a white sauce, but the farmhouse version can include vegetables and a roux-based dark or light sauce. I&#8217;m a fan of the dark sauce, with delicious flavor, although I&#8217;ll admit I like to steal the fine dining use of vermouth to flavor the sauce. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003661.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>The regularly-updated content I promised here on Juniorbird.com? Well, here&#8217;s part 1 of the complete calendar: a monthly fun drink that you can join me in boozing it up with! This month&#8217;s drink is the Rob Roy &#8212; a version of the Manhattan made with Scotch. (A Manhattan is basically a Martini, but with whiskey, traditionally Rye.) A Manhattan should be sweeter, richer, and more flavorful than the dry, understated Martini; the Rob Roy adds on to that Scotch&#8217;s traditional peaty flavors.<br />

							<p>I realized I was all grown up late last week. It&#8217;s been quite hot here in Southern California, and my apartment has enough power to run either my air conditioner or the freezer chest for the chemical ice my company ships with. I bet you can guess who wins that. Anyway, it&#8217;s hot. And usually hot weather makes me want good things, like Lik-M-Aid, Big Red soda, and fried dough. But, this summer, it made me want fruit.<br />

							<p>I fear I&#8217;m about to make a great many enemies; but it can&#8217;t be avoided. Sometimes, one has strong opinions, and it&#8217;s at those times that one must stand up and state one&#8217;s beliefs, damn the consequences. This is one of those times. And this is my belief: A Martini is not a gin drink, or a vodka drink: it&#8217;s a vermouth drink. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003342.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I&#8217;ve been drinking a lot more wine lately &#8212; about a bottle a week. I&#8217;ve always enjoyed wine, and it was finally time to learn about it, which means trying a lot. I have little storage room, so there&#8217;s not much space for me to keep around bottles that I don&#8217;t plan to drink soon; but there are two bottles that have been taking up precious wine rack space for a while now.<br />

							<h3>One (Exceedingly Small) Miracle</h3>
							<p class="date">Jun 16, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_food.html">Food</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I have food allergies. For the sake of simplicity, it&#8217;s easiest to say that I&#8217;m allergic to pretty much everything. If accuracy is a priority, then I&#8217;m specifically allergic to corn &#8212; whose byproducts are in most everything &#8212; and to cow&#8217;s milk, whose byproducts are in most everything else. For extra added bonus I&#8217;m also allergic to pineapple and dates. None of this fine food will kill me or anything crazy like that, it&#8217;ll just make me boring to hang out with, unless your idea of a good time is rifling through my stuff while I&#8217;m in the bathroom. So, for years, I&#8217;ve avoided anything that most of the readers of this blog would consider &#8220;food&#8221;. Or, at least, anything that most of the readers of this blog would consider &#8220;yay food!&#8221; But now, there may be hope &#8212; there may be something that we can do about my little excessive histamine response problem. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002672.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Egg Nog was quite the tradition in my family; I loved, my grandmother loved it, and, well, with those two powerful votes in favor, my parents would drink it too. But, add in a milk allergy and, starting a few years ago, a few glasses poured from a carton from the supermarket became nothing more than a nice memory. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002158.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<h3>Merry Xmas to Me!</h3>
							<p class="date">Dec  7, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_food.html">Food</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Three years ago, I got a Sur La Table gift certificate for Christmas. I&#8217;d always meant to use it for cooking classes but I <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001125.php">only managed to use it once</a> and, as much fun as that one experience was, it hardly drained the gift card. Throughout the year since I&#8217;ve looked at the calendar and tried to make time for the classes I wanted to take, but I never seemed to be able to schedule them in. As it got closer to Christmas and I started thinking of food-related gifts for some of my friends, I started to feel guilty about my unspent gift card. After a few days of bouncing back and forth, I finally decided to blow the cards on kitchen stuff. After all, who doesn&#8217;t need kitchen stuff? <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002113.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>It was a wonderful summer. One of the many perks of being the child of two university professors was a month-long family vacation, every summer, and this one was in France. Now, France is a good thing for a seven-year-old, to the extent that a seven-year-old notices France, but what really stood out was the ice cream. Sure, it was all better than American ice cream, but my favorite was Smurf flavor (in French, &#8220;Schtroumpf&#8221;).  <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001836.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>One of the many injustices and trials heaped upon little ol&#8217; me in this life is that I&#8217;m <a href="http://allergies.about.com/cs/corn/a/aa053199.htm">allergic to corn</a>. I actually figured this out a few years ago after spending a couple of years being sick and miserable all the time! But removing corn from my diet has been difficult, it&#8217;s in <em>everything</em>. I cook a lot of my own food, and eat a lot of organic stuff, but who wants to eat crunchy-granola additive-free foods all the time? That&#8217;s why I thank goodness for corn-free foods imported from third-world countries. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001202.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

And what&#8217;s better than a shared love? So, no prix fixe menu at a packed 21-Food-score-on-Zagat restaurant for me and my Wonderful Girlfriend; instead, our big Valentine&#8217;s Day event was a <a href="http://www.cmiregistration.com/user/org/program.jxp?org=287&amp;id=22015">cooking class for couples</a> at Sur La Table. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001125.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
