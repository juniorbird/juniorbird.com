							<h3>Getting Productive on the Mac</h3>
							<p class="date">May 12, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_elsewhere.html">Elsewhere</a></p>
							
							<p>I&#8217;m a big systems guy: I think that, if you&#8217;re doing something repeatable and everyday, you should make it into a system that makes it easy to do over and over again without actually having to think much. I had such a system <a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/productivity/easy_gtd_with_outlook_and_the_palm_treo.php">on my PC</a>. Remarkably, despite the plethora of pretty brilliant task- and information-management applications on the Mac, it&#8217;s only now that I think I&#8217;ve gotten an equal-quality system on the Mac.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/productivity/getting_productive_on_the_mac.php">Read on&#8230;</a>
						
									
				
					
							
							<h3>What's the Best State for Small Business Taxes?</h3>
							<p class="date">Apr 18, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_elsewhere.html">Elsewhere</a></p>
							
							<p>It&#8217;s tax season, and I&#8217;m as interested in how much the government is taking out of my pocket as the next guy. So I was intrigued to learn of a new <a href="http://www.sbecouncil.org/businesstaxindex2009/">small business-focused ranking of state tax burdens</a> from <a href="http://twitter.com/WSJSmallBiz"><em>Wall Street Journal</em> Small Business reporter Kelly Spors</a>. Now, I&#8217;ve started two businesses in famously high-tax California, and I&#8217;ve never found taxes to be a big enough problem that any of my time was justified in thinking about them rather than running the other parts of the business. But I know that a lot of businesses that have been around longer and are in more of a sustaining than a growth mode have real concerns about tax burdens, so I was looking forward to reading and learning from this report. Unfortunately, the ranking is comically sloppy.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/business/whats_the_best_state_for_small_business_taxes.php">Read on&#8230;</a>

Kind of a rare event, actually - these days, it&#8217;s more about Tivo and delivery; a craving for <a href="http://pinkberry.com">Pinkberry</a> brought us out for the takeout from the Asian place next door. It occurred to us that, ten years ago, movie and takeout would&#8217;ve been a typical weekend evening for almost everyone - how much business must the restaurants in the same strip malls as Blockbuster have done? And how much has Netflix killed these restaurants?</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/business/videos_main_course.php">Read on&#8230;</a>
						
									
				
					
							
							<h3>We Mean Business: Wagville</h3>

							<p><a href="http://wagville.com">Wagville</a> is a Los Angeles doggie boarding and day care facility founded and run by Harvard grad and former lawyer <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/ppl/webprofile?id=18152133">Julie Shine</a>. Like the other <span class="caps"><span class="caps">WMB </span></span>subjects, Wagville isn&#8217;t making enough money. We quickly learn that:</p>


<ul>
<li>The company does little to no retail business, despite having a large (and cluttered) storefront</li>
<li>Check-in takes minutes on a slow system</li>
<li>There are no facilities for people, just for the dogs</li>
<li>Employees are unmotivated and ill-tempered</li>
<li>Julie cannot motivate staff and may be a micromanager</li>
<li>There are 27 employees in a business that&#8217;s caring for no more than 60 dogs at any time, and the costs add up - in one month, Wagville did $90,000 in sales but had $65,000 in payroll and so couldn&#8217;t make a profit</li>
<li>Julie is focused on providing a service to dogs, not on making profit</li>
<li>Julie is carrying crushing credit card debt in order to keep the place running</li>
</ul>

							<h3>Yahoosoft &mdash; Where does that $45B Number Come From?</h3>

							<p>Microsoft&#8217;s proposal to acquire Yahoo for $45 billion is both unexpected and widely-foreseen. Pundits have, for some time now, <a href="http://watchmojo.com/web/blog/index.php/2007/04/18/yhoo-let-one-rip-and-everyone-in-the-room-heard-it/">suggested that might be a reasonable course of action</a>. But the purchase price is clearly aggressive, at $31/share for a stock that had closed at under $19 the day before. In fact, as <a href="http://weblogs.jupiterresearch.com/analysts/gartenberg/archives/2008/02/dear_yahoo_shar.html">Jupiter&#8217;s Michael Gartenberg puts it</a>, this proposal looks more like Microsoft is saying &#8220;Dear Yahoo Shareholder: How would you like to get Yahoo&#8217;s share price from six months ago back, tomorrow?&#8221; Where&#8217;s the logic behind this price?</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/business/yahoosoft_where_does_that_45b_number_come_from.php">Read on&#8230;</a>

In Macworld after Macworld, Apple has revealed products that represented long bets &#8212; the iPod, the iTunes Music Store, Apple <span class="caps"><span class="caps">TV, </span></span>iWork &#8212; and, if you look at Macworld with the same strategic eye as Jobs, there&#8217;s indications of the future there.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/business/macworld_2008_and_apples_strategy.php">Read on&#8230;</a>

							<p>On top of their mostly-symbolic cut to the discount rate a month ago, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2007/09/18/news/economy/fed_rates/index.htm?cnn=yes">the Fed has now cut the Federal Funds rate</a>, hopefully lowering lenders&#8217; interest rates and saving the economy from a Real Estate bubble-fueled recession. This is a dangerous game: the added credit availability may not trickle down to homeowners or other consumers, and the new liquidity may simply allow predatory and irresponsible lenders to cover their own losses while not learning a thing. This cut is a gift to the lenders &#8212; and shows that what we need is a policy solution to this housing crisis.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/business/bernankes_gift_to_the_banks.php">Read on&#8230;</a>

But it&#8217;s tough when you&#8217;re sending 30lb boxes of perishable goods around the country. Shipping costs can be equal to product costs for some East Coast destinations &#8212; and this cuts down on my sales. It&#8217;s tough, but there is a silver lining.

I&#8217;m sure you know those times &#8212; I should do something, it&#8217;s actually kind of important, but it&#8217;s either inconvenient or impossible and so I don&#8217;t do it right then. And then the moment passes and the thought is lost or the task becomes even harder to do. For a while, recording my mileage, keeping up on my credit card purchases, and even capturing ideas on-the-go were all in this category. But, lately, I&#8217;ve been doing a lot better &#8212; because I made the effort to set myself up to be productive in a moment, any moment.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/productivity/productivity_in_a_moment.php">Read on&#8230;</a>

							<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of Getting Things Done; but I haven&#8217;t been very <span class="caps"><span class="caps">GTD</span></span>-y lately. With too much on my plate, I fell off the wagon.

<p>The answer isn&#8217;t in the failure of the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">GTD </span></span>approach &#8212; it&#8217;s in the failure of my implementation.

							<h3>Knowledge Supply Chain Management</h3>
							<p class="date">May 30, 2007 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_elsewhere.html">Elsewhere</a></p>
							
							<p>My father, who writes about issues in education in <a href="http://www.changinghighereducation.com/">his blog</a>, recently suggested that <a href="http://www.changinghighereducation.com/2006/03/what_business_a.html">universities are in the knowledge supply chain management business</a>. That made me ask myself: if there is a knowledge supply chain, then there must somewhere be an inventory of knowledge, right? My father argues that <a href="http://www.changinghighereducation.com/2007/04/who_are_our_cus.html">inventory is held in the universities</a>, which create and collect knowledge, but I&#8217;d say that knowledge inventory is much more held in the hands of university graduates, who store knowledge in case their employers ever need it. This just-in-time inventory system allows businesses to avoid investing in knowledge creation and management, but means that individuals &#8212; the player with the least ability to pay &#8212; are stuck holding the inventory and paying the purchase and holding cost thereof. As college educations become more expensive, we must shift knowledge inventory-holding from individuals and to universities; if universities help us do this, they can make more money doling out that knowledge to in a just-in-time manner than they do pushing that inventory into the personal inventory of hundreds of thousands of grads every year.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/business/knowledge_supply_chain_management.php">Read on&#8230;</a>

							<p>I&#8217;ve been buying business cards for my new employees lately, giving me a lot of time to think about what exactly makes a good business card. Business cards are surprisingly important business tools, but many of the cards that you&#8217;ll see out there today are surprisingly bad at being useful tools. Many boring, traditional cards are actually much better at being business cards than are beautiful, clever, cutting-edge pieces.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/business/giving_good_business_card.php">Read on&#8230;</a>

							<p>How many times have you been working away and suddenly thought &#8220;Gah!

I&#8217;ve found that one of the keys to my productivity is to get them out of my head as quickly as possible &#8212; that means a fast way to take notes without actually taking my head out of the work I&#8217;m supposed to be doing.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/productivity/fast_gtdstyle_windows_and_palm_notes_with_launchy_autohotkey_and_bonsai.php">Read on&#8230;</a>

							<p>A few weeks ago, John Gruber and Tantek Celik wrote about ease-of-use in software programs and how the mental activity required to carry out a task on a computer is some multiple of the number of steps involved in that task. Tasks with more steps are more difficult, they assert, and more disruptive. I&#8217;m inclined to agree, which is why I use two Windows programs, Launchy and AutoHotKey to make some of my everyday activities take fewer steps and take me away from my work less.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/productivity/boost_your_windows_productivity_with_launchy_and_autohotkey.php">Read on&#8230;</a>

							<p>A few weeks ago, I suggested that the recording and movie industries outsource their challenge to create a new business model. By having VCs and entrepreneurs attempt to implement industry group-approved business plans, it seemed to me that these industries could shift all of the risk of figuring out what was next onto other individuals while reaping all of the rewards from emerging distribution channels. The recording industry, at least, has made it clear that they have no intention of doing any such thing. They asked, and got, an increase in the royalties paid to artists by online radio stations, an increase to a level that will probably drive all of these radio stations &#8212; this entire emerging distribution channel &#8212; out of business.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/business/the_recording_industry_is_clearly_not_taking_my_advice.php">Read on&#8230;</a>

							<p>It&#8217;s not a good time to be an American automaker. Ford is undergoing yet another restructuring, only two years after starting their last one.

							<h3>A Free Business Model For the Music and Movie Industries</h3>

							<p>Mark Cuban <a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/2007/02/07/what-should-the-music-biz-do-next">thinks that the music labels should get together and start a company to stand against Apple&#8217;s iTunes and Microsoft</a>. I agree that the music labels, and, for good measure, the movie and tv studios need to get out from under the thumb of the tech industry, which so far has controlled the next-generation distribution channels. But for the music industry to start its own company is risky and expensive. Instead, the music industry needs to leverage this country&#8217;s great capital markets and reservoir of mobile knowledge workers to get someone else to do the hard work for them. That is, they need to outsource their risk, and they - and the movie industry - can do this without losing their returns.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/business/a_free_business_model_for_the_music_and_movie_industries.php">Read on&#8230;</a>

							<p>I &#8212; rather belatedly &#8212; saw the new James Bond movie this weekend. After years of Bonds who were indistinct from any other action hero, Casino Royale finally gives us a satisfying, absorbing Bond. The theater at which I saw this movie even offered me a nice bit of gratitude: &#8220;Thank you for choosing Pacific Theaters,&#8221; the promo reel said as it ran before the movie. Unfortunately for the producers of this clip, I didn&#8217;t choose Pacific Theaters. Like most people, I chose the convenient place and time for the movie, not the specific theater chain. Theater chains are a commodity: all are essentially equivalent to the consumer. Commoditization is a serious threat to almost every product, but these same theater chains show us some ways all of us entrepreneurs can avoid becoming commodities too.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/business/james_bond_a_commodity.php">Read on&#8230;</a>

							<p>I&#8217;ll admit it, I&#8217;m a geek; that&#8217;s why I can&#8217;t resist the idea of a show that has inventors coming up with clever (or preposterous) ideas and pitching those ideas on <span class="caps"><span class="caps">TV.</span></span> So now I&#8217;m doing a <a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/entrepreneurship/american_inventor_episode_1_recap.php">recap every week</a> featuring (hopefully) clever commentary. Hopefully the show will stay good and I&#8217;ll be able to pick up the episodes of My Name is Earl and The Office that I missed during repeats (no, I&#8217;m not ready to buy them off of iTunes&#8230; yet).</p><a href="I&amp;#8217;ll admit it, I&amp;#8217;m a geek; that&amp;#8217;s why I can&amp;#8217;t resist the idea of a show that has inventors coming...">Read on&#8230;</a>

							<h3>(Re)Introducing WadeArmstrong.com</h3>
							<p class="date">Jan 29, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_elsewhere.html">Elsewhere</a></p>
							
							<p>Those of you who have been around for a while may remember that I used to have a blog over at WadeArmstrong.com, which I used as a part of my b-school application. Well, I&#8217;ve threatened for about a year that I&#8217;d bring back my eponymous site as a more-professional face to me; now I&#8217;ve gone and done it.</p>

<p>WadeArmstrong.com is intended as a marketing tool for myself, a networking tool, and a place where I can collaborate on projects with my&#8230; um&#8230; collaborators. It&#8217;s got a blog and a wiki and a contact form and a downloadable resume and that&#8217;s about it, but I think it&#8217;s moderately clever and maybe even a little fun to look at. At least it&#8217;s the same color as one of my favorite shirts. I&#8217;m planning to blog there about business, entrepreneurship, technology, productivity, and, well, me.</p>

<p>So check out <a href="http://wadearmstrong.com">WadeArmstrong.com</a>, and check out my latest entry, analyzing <a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/business/disneypixar_why.php">why Disney may have bought Pixar</a>. It was like the pulling of the teeth, oy, writing a fairly-long, professional-stylee article like that, but, with practice, I know it&#8217;ll get easier and my writing will even get something approaching coherent. Tell me what you think! And, if you&#8217;re interested in these topics, what you&#8217;d like to see me write about in the future; I plan to write one of these quotes professional unquotes things a week.</p><a href="Those of you who have been around for a while may remember that I used to have a blog over at WadeArmstrong.com, which I used as a part of my b-school application.

							<h3>Site #2, Version #2</h3>
							<p class="date">Feb 12, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_elsewhere.html">Elsewhere</a></p>
							
							<p>My other site over at <a href="http://cleverbird.com">cleverbird.com</a> has been reasonably busy since the beginning my b-school days. I&#8217;d been adding info about various things &#8212; especially <a href="http://cleverbird.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/JobSearchTips/JobSearchTips">finding a job</a> every so often, and, frankly, I&#8217;d outgrown <a href="http://cleverbird.com/pwyky">what was there</a>. So today, in an exceptionally aggressive effort to avoid doing work, I made some changes.</p>

<p>I changed two things in particular:</p>


<ul>
<li>I switched to a new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">wiki</a> engine, <a href="http://www.pmwiki.org/">PmWiki</a></li>
<li>I <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhyRefactorWikiPages">refactored</a> all of my content</li>
</ul>



<h3>Moving to PmWiki</h3>

<p>I had started out using <a href="http://infomesh.net/pwyky/">pwyky</a> as my engine, principally because it was:</p>


<ul>
<li>Easy to install without command-line access</li>
<li>Written in <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>, which I can at least pretend to know</li>
<li>Because it was written in Python, and missing some key features, I thought I&#8217;d add the features to learn more about Python</li>
</ul>



<p>Six months later, those reasons don&#8217;t make as much sense. The features that weren&#8217;t there by and large still arent, because I haven&#8217;t had time to add them. And I&#8217;m recognizing further that, in the future, I&#8217;ll be programming the Web less, and using clever tools like MT and wikis more. Instead, I needed a wiki that was:</p>


<ul>
<li>Still easy to install without command-line access</li>
<li>Offered some kind of security so everyone couldn&#8217;t just change my pages</li>
<li>Offered robust text formatting</li>
<li>Accepted at least some <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTML </span></span>in pages</li>
<li>Had a reasonable templating system so that I could make it non-hideous</li>
</ul>



<p>Apart from being easy-to-install and non-hideous by defaulty, pwyky sadly was none of these.</p>

<p>After a search, I found PmWiki. It&#8217;s hideous by default, but it has a clever templating system and every other feature I could want. Initial experience suggests it will be a very satisfactory solution.</p>

<h3>Refactoring</h3>

<p>Pwyky offers no export function; PmWiki offers no import. Someday &#8212; probably around the time I get my next wiki engine &#8212; both of these will be must-have features. For the moment, I had few enough pages that I could just cut-and-paste from one wiki to the other. As I was doing so, I realized that cleverbird.com&#8217;s initial organization didn&#8217;t make that much sense. For example, the home page linked to different pages based on the format, not the content, of those pages &#8212; there was actually a top-level link for &#8220;lists.&#8221; </p>

<p>In the name of being reasonable, I organized the new cleverbird.com around the kinds of information I offered. And I split the pages up to facilitate that kind of organization. Yeah, there was a fair amount of rewriting, but that was fun. Now I&#8217;ve just got to make those pages look non-hideous.</p><a href="My other site over at http://cleverbird.com has been reasonably busy since the beginning my b-school days.
