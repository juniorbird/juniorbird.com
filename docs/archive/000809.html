				<p>Yesterday&#8217;s Leadership class was actually pretty good. Great, even. That&#8217;s a shocker &#8212; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/000791.html">Posner</a> really added some value!</p>

<p>I did benefit disproportionately from the class, it&#8217;s true, because I was up there for 30 minutes getting my presenting style critiqued. I actually learned a lot! I wish that I had been prepared in some way (one of the main complaints was that I read directly from my notes, which happened, of course, because I wasn&#8217;t prepared), but, honestly, since none of the previous classes had been of any value, I didn&#8217;t think there was any justification for me putting the time in to get ready for class. Practicing a speech two or three times can take, well, minutes, and Posner hadn&#8217;t even justified that so far.</p>

<p>But he did yesterday. Class was fun, a lot of people got to speak and get critiqued, and Posner was even relatively brief when he talked. Now, I&#8217;m saying relatively, here &#8212; he still droned on at a few points and lost my attention completely, but the point is that, later, I started paying attention again, <em>because I thought it might be worth it</em>. This, folks, may be a breakthrough. We&#8217;ll see if he keeps it up!</p>
