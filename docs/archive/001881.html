				<p>Anybody who&#8217;s ever watched me primp for a date knows that I&#8217;m a total primadonna when it comes to hair care products. I like the good stuff, and I&#8217;ll spend on it (something which various of my hairstylists have loved, I&#8217;m sure). Usually, I go for some relatively cutting-edge product, then move on to the next cutting-edge product when the first one becomes hard to find anywhere outside of Sally Beauty Supply. But now it&#8217;s different. Now I look fabulous and I do it with product I got at Target &#8212; and at Target prices.</p>

<p>It all starts with my dandruff. See, I have a fairly mild case of the ol&#8217; &#8220;don&#8217;t wear black shirts&#8221; disease, but I do wash with a dandruff shampoo every couple of days to keep the flakes under control. Sadly, these shampoos dry my scalp out, which brings my dandruff back from dry skin after a few weeks. I then have to switch dandruff shampoos so that my scalp is abused in a new way, gaining another reprieve from the head snow. And, etc.</p>

<p>The search for a shampoo that doesn&#8217;t dry my scalp has been a long and hard one, but, lured in by one of the few ads through which I didn&#8217;t fast-forward, I decided to essay a bottle of Garnier Fructis Dandruff Shampoo. The price was right, and why not? And then&#8230; it worked! My dandruff is gone and my scalp not too dry!</p>

<p>So, when I ran out of the paste I&#8217;d been enjoying lately, I thought, hey, I liked the last Garnier product, down-market as the brand may be. So I picked up a container of their new putty, and loved it too! My hair looks as sexy as ever, and at a sixth the price. Thanks, Garnier!</p>

                    <p>A couple of the things in my collection are dandruff related (particularly the prescription-strength dandruff shampoo, which I use about once a week).  Most of it&#8217;s just there because my hair is incredibly finicky, though, and wants different treatment depending on the weather, or cosmic rays, or something. :-P</p>
