							<h3>Costa Rica-Bound</h3>
							<p class="date">Dec 24, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_travel.html">Travel</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Tomorrow, excessively early, I&#8217;m off to Costa Rica for a bit more than a week&#8217;s vacation. I&#8217;ll be traveling to the Pacific Coast towns of Playa Tamarindo and Montezuma, maybe&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002159.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Tha Nogg</h3>
							<p class="date">Dec 24, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_food.html">Food</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Egg Nog was quite the tradition in my family; I loved, my grandmother loved it, and, well, with those two powerful votes in favor, my parents would drink it too. But, add in a milk allergy and, starting a few years ago, a few glasses poured from a carton from the supermarket became nothing more than a nice memory. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002158.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Regiftification</h3>
							<p class="date">Dec 23, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_true_life_stories.html">True Life Stories</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Every year, thousands, if not millions, fall victim to the social faux-pas called &#8220;regifting.&#8221; These poor souls get gifts given to others, gifts which were unsatisfying to the original recipient and thus have been passed along to the next unwitting giftee. There is wholesale gift-related recycling in my family, but it&#8217;s not of the content of the brightly-wrapped boxes under each year&#8217;s tree; it&#8217;s of the brightly-colored wrapping itself. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002156.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Yes, I know my <span class="caps">RSS </span>feed is broken. No, I don&#8217;t know why. I&#8217;ll figure it out when I get home from Costa Rica.

							<h3>Symbiosis</h3>
							<p class="date">Dec 22, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_true_life_stories.html">True Life Stories</a></p>
						    	
							<p>My grandmother&#8217;s best friend is 97. My grandmother, who is quite mobile but mostly blind, is 93; Juanita<sup>*</sup> has limited mobility but can see better than most people half her age. They go out together, Juanita driving, my grandmother helping Juanita walk, then they have lunch together and gossip about people long gone, reminiscing together about the scandals and achievments that once excited and amused them. Listening to them, it&#8217;s like fans watching a favorite movie again, appreciating new details of every scene even as it&#8217;s replayed the forty-seventh time. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002154.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Cuisine Non Minceur</h3>

							<p>I know you all, my beloved readers, know me as Wade, but you can just call me <a href="http://www.lardlad.com/assets/quotes/season5/cape.shtml">fatty fat fat</a>. That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m portly, I&#8217;m rotund, I&#8217;m disgusting, I can no longer see my belt buckle, I am unattractive to the other sex and I&#8217;m now unable to fit into some of the coture in my closet. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002151.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>The Wonder Of Coach Class</h3>
							<p class="date">Dec 20, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_travel.html">Travel</a></p>
						    	
							<p>It&#8217;s fairly well-known that I&#8217;m weird, but this common knowledge doesn&#8217;t necessarily extend to the realization that I actually prefer flying coach. Despite my bad knee, despite my long legs, despite my penchant for horribly overpacked carry-ons, I like being squeezed in like a sardine. Why? Well, it&#8217;s the company. You meet the most interesting people in coach. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002149.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>The Inertia of Indolence</h3>
							<p class="date">Dec 18, 2005 in </p>
						    	
							<p>One thing about vacation: it&#8217;s tempting to follow the path of sheer indolence, but life generally expects some fairly high level of activity to complete socially-accepted activities. The other half of that is that, once one indulges that temptation towards indolence, there&#8217;s an intertia that virtually demands continuing &#8212; if not growing &#8212; levels of indolence. As Newton says, objects at rest stay at rest. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002135.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Mmmm, Ice Cream</h3>
							<p class="date">Dec 16, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_food.html">Food</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Since I can&#8217;t eat cow&#8217;s milk, my life has been rather ice cream-free lately. Sure, there are soy- and rice-based substitutes, but, with a few exceptions, they&#8217;re pretty mediocre.

							<h3>Attack of the Killer Cockatoo of Death</h3>
							<p class="date">Dec 11, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_junior.html">Junior</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Junior may have finally done it; he&#8217;s always been (like any cockatoo) a bit of a destroyer of precious posessions, but he may have finally destroyed the one thing I love more than him. Yes, that&#8217;s right, my bird ate TiVo. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002126.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<h3>Camera Pr0n</h3>
							<p class="date">Dec  9, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_photos.html">Photos</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I have this theory that I have four types of readers: those who prefer <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_true_life_stories.php">true life stories</a>, those who like to hear about <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_food.php">food</a>, those who like my <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_photos.php">photos</a>, and those who come here for my <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000598.php">technical</a> <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000599.php">articles</a> from their searches on Google, etc. I know I haven&#8217;t provided much for my photo-focused readers lately, but, since Juniorbird.com is all about serving you and catering to your interests, I thought I&#8217;d put something together for  you all. And that something is: my new 70-300mm telephoto. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002119.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Merry Xmas to Me!</h3>
							<p class="date">Dec  7, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_food.html">Food</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Three years ago, I got a Sur La Table gift certificate for Christmas. I&#8217;d always meant to use it for cooking classes but I <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001125.php">only managed to use it once</a> and, as much fun as that one experience was, it hardly drained the gift card. Throughout the year since I&#8217;ve looked at the calendar and tried to make time for the classes I wanted to take, but I never seemed to be able to schedule them in. As it got closer to Christmas and I started thinking of food-related gifts for some of my friends, I started to feel guilty about my unspent gift card. After a few days of bouncing back and forth, I finally decided to blow the cards on kitchen stuff. After all, who doesn&#8217;t need kitchen stuff? <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002113.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>After years of thinking it was apocryphal, I&#8217;ve finally fallen victim to that most feared &#8212; and stereotypcial &#8212; affliction of suburbia: bellybutton lint.

							<p>Thank you for <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001818.php">upgrading my voice mail system</a>. I very much appreciate that you managed to replace a simple, effective old system with something that is new, annoying, and not nearly as well-suited to the usage patterns of any conceivable user of your services. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002100.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
