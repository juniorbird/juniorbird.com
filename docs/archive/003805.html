				<p>We were playing a three-way game of hockey &#8212; us, the Finnish national team, and the Swedish national team, that is. With only two ends to the ice, we&#8217;d switch one team out when enough goals were scored against them. Except those darned Swedes never seemed to get scored on &#8212; they had their strategy down, and Wayne Gretzky<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003805.html#fn1">1</a></sup> in goal.</p>

<p>Their strategy was actually simple. See, there were three ways to score points:</p>


<ul>
<li>There were plastic bowls on the ice, dozens of them, that you could shoot just like a puck.</li>
<li>There was a big pot of hot water in front of each goal, a couple of feet beyond the crease, with a ladle in it; and a big pot in each goal. You scored a point for each ladle of water you poured into the pot in the goal.</li>
<li>In the water were boiled vegetables. You could throw those into the goal using the ladle, and got a point for each vegetable you threw into the goal &#8212; but first you had to get some water into the pot in the goal.</li>
</ul>



<p>The crafty Swedes had a strategy that was keeping them un-scored on</p>


<ul>
<li>Every time Gretzky blocked a bowl, he came out and put that bowl into a pile of other bowls. There were enough bowl-piles just outside the crease that you couldn&#8217;t really shoot from far away, and, if you tried to skate in close with a bowl, a Swedish defenseman only had to plug the small gap between two bowl-piles and you couldn&#8217;t even get in to make a shot. If you skated in without a bowl, there were no lose bowls inside the piles, so you couldn&#8217;t shoot anything.</li>
<li>Gretzky was physically standing in the pot, so he could easily block you if you tried to pour the water in.</li>
</ul>



<p>So I came up with a strategy. I hid down in the corner of the rink, behind the goal, while our good players shot bowls into their bowl-piles, breaking up the bowl-piles. In seconds, the swarming Swedish defenders were re-building their piles, and Gretzky had climbed out of the pot and was busy policing the bowls that had gotten inside their crease. Suddenly, I dashed in, grabbed a dipperfull of water, and slid head-first into the goal, pouring the water in the pot as I did. As I scrambled to my feet, Gretzky ran into the goal and climbed back in the pot; but by then I was at the pot of boiling water. I fished out a vegetable with the dipper and whipped it at full speed, right into Gretzky, who wasn&#8217;t expecting a green onion to come his way. It hit him square in the chest, scoring a point. As he tried to pick it off, I flung a bright red rutabaga at him, and then another green onion, and then a carrot, scoring points all the while. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the Finns suiting up for their turn on the ice.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> I&#8217;m fully aware that Wayne Gretzky is, in fact, Canadian. Apparently, my subconscious is not.</p>
