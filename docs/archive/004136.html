				<p>Back during the dot-com days &#8212; or, as about half of my new co-workers call it, &#8220;when I was in High School&#8221; &#8212; I thought I&#8217;d be a product manager at a technology company. I worked at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010720170622/http://www.bigbuttons.com/" target="_blank">a great little start-up</a> where I was given tons of freedom to do cool things for our clients, with technology we were just beginning to evolve. My job was to be a project manager, and I figured out how to customize and deploy our product for our clients; but I admired the people who pointed our product in the next direction even more.</p><p>Now, this was a great job: it paid way too well (enough to support my roommates as they started a company, actually); there was an unending supply of <a href="http://coffeebean.com/French-Deluxe-Vanilla-P656C75.aspx?Page=1" target="_blank">French Deluxe Vanilla</a> to put in my tea; a laptop of my very own; meeting someone who&#8217;s still one of my best friends; and the right to say &#8220;I&#8217;m working at a dot-com&#8221; itself. Good stuff. But nothing&#8217;s an unalloyed blessing, and, in this case, I had to hear one song over and over again. Over and over so many times that I can still sing it in my head, even though I wish I&#8217;d forgotten every single word. I wish I could&#8217;ve told it <a href="http://coffeebean.com/French-Deluxe-Vanilla-P656C75.aspx?Page=1" target="_blank">bye bye bye</a>.</p><p>Worst of all, it was just the first measure played almost nonstop. Not that there was a fan in the office &#8212; we were into <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GF8RGbu3X8" target="_blank">different</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2QSDx8Lhl8" target="_blank">stuff</a> &#8212; it was that we were pitching their label; I had to do research and customization of their product, which meant tons of trips to their Web site; and, like good netizens of the era, they had an awesome <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815052750/http://www.nsync.com/" target="_blank">flash intro</a>. Bye bye! it played every time I visited. I guess I should&#8217;ve known I&#8217;d end up bolting to join my roommates at their company.</p><p>And that was the last time that I had a real job that I thought of as a career. Not to knock a job, but who doesn&#8217;t want to be the master of their own universe at 24? I found myself doing my own start-ups, not that that&#8217;s not a career path, but, with a start-up the there is already there, as it were. It&#8217;s just that you have to make it big. Although I made some awesome things, it turned out that there was too little there of the there that was there. Or something. The metaphor starts breaking down here. Sorry. Hey, I&#8217;m a blogger, I&#8217;m allowed to write myself into a corner!</p><p>Anyway, the point is, I got a job. I was tired of eating only what I could kill, and I wanted to join a pack and bring down some larger beasts. Okay, that metaphor didn&#8217;t go anywhere either. But the whole looking-for-a-job-thing did, and now I&#8217;m at <a href="http://atomiconline.com" target="_blank">a really great company</a> having a great time being a Product Manager.</p><p>It&#8217;s kind of enthralling, actually &#8212; when I left my Web design company, all the cool stuff I was working on had to do with content management systems. Now, eight years later, I&#8217;ve found myself working on&#8230; content management systems. Which appear to still be an area ripe for innovation. I&#8217;ve missed a lot but, in a number of ways, I haven&#8217;t missed all that much.</p><p>Anyway, I get to work with <a href="http://wrestlezone.com" target="_blank">some</a> <a href="http://gamerevolution.com" target="_blank">great</a> <a href="http://sherdog.com" target="_blank">content</a>, and with great people. And I love where I am. This is my space (yes, I am one of those annoying people who sits on an exercise ball; worse, I&#8217;m converting my cow-orkers to it:</p><p>Yeah, I love it at Atomic. So much that this will be very nearly my only blog entry ever on on it. Although, if you&#8217;re lucky, I&#8217;ll finish one of the 7 or 8 half-written pieces I have on Product Management.</p><p>Anyway, for the four or five consistent readers I have, who&#8217;ve heard me mention &#8220;a new job&#8221; for a while&#8230; that&#8217;s what it is! Oh, and for the two or three readers I have who work in the biz, <a href="http://www.atomiconline.com/careers/item/1175-product-manager" target="_blank">you can come work with me</a> if you want to!</p><p>And, as for my new cow-orkers: I&#8217;ll see you at the office! And at happy hour. And, maybe, at a cool restaurant. But not on Facebook. Because that just seems like a bad idea. Like I said, I really, really like this job!</p>
