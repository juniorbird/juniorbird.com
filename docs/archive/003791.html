				<p>So, I&#8217;m a little behind this year &#8212; usually I have my resolutions up in the first week of the year or so. Frankly, one of my problems lately has been commitment to blogging, and I was slow getting to this post because of that. Well, I bet that shows up on my resolutions! So, on to the usual format.</p>

<h3>Last Year&#8217;s Resolutions Reviewed</h3>


<ol>
<li>Join Toastmasters<br /><em>Apparently, I&#8217;ve been bad at this every year since b-school. I failed to find the time to make this a priority last year.</em></li>
<li>Stick with Krav, and, especially, use it to improve my conditioning<br /><em>Big success here. We were up to 3x/week for 2 hours each time before a series of flus and injuries got us off-track.</em></li>
<li>Post twice weekly to WadeArmstrong.com &#8212; one 4-600 words, one links<br /><em>I did pretty well here for most of the year, especially on the longer entry (which ended up being a lot more than 600 words ususally).</em> </li>
<li>Post twice weekly here. I&#8217;ve got an exciting publishing calendar for Juniorbird.com, including a recipe of the month; drink of the month; photo that you can put on your desktop (I like to switch mine up), and even an attempt at ongoing fiction (I promise low quality!)<br /><em>Commitment problems here! Also, I think that a lot of what I was promising to write was not what I wanted to have on Juniorbird.com &#8212; for a while, it was looking like a cooking blog, which I just don&#8217;t want it to be.</em></li>
<li>Kick up the &#8216;ol wardrobe a notch, by being a bit more daring<br /><em>Have you seen me lately? Socks ftw!</em></li>
<li>Assert myself more in restaurants &#8212; I don&#8217;t always ask what&#8217;s in a dish when I order it, and sometimes, what with my food allergies, that reaches up and bites me<br /><em>Moderate success here. I&#8217;ve asked much more than before but should probably do even more.</em></li>
<li>Set up a regular get-together with school friends<br /><em>I did very poorly on this. Very poorly.</em></li>
<li>Appreciate the <span class="caps">AIG </span>as much as she deserves<br /><em>I hope I did well! I certainly tried.</em><br />
 <br />
So I basically did three all-out, two halfways, and three pretty much nos. I&#8217;m still on the positive side of this balance sheet, but let&#8217;s see if I can do better this year!</li>
</ol>



<h3>This Year&#8217;s Resolutions</h3>


<ol>
<li>Go to more networking events, and go to them regularly, to meet more people.</li>
<li>Go to at least two Marshall Tailgates, to see my friends from school.</li>
<li>Continue to post twice weekly to WadeArmstrong.com.</li>
<li>Post at least once a week here to Juniorbird.com, including regular, but not monthly, meal and drink recipes.</li>
<li>Start a mystery book-writing club, and get far into writing a (blockbuster!) mystery.</li>
<li>Get my orange belt in Krav Maga.</li>
<li>Travel at least once this year, probably out of the country.</li>
<li>Lose 20 lbs. &#8212; I started the year at 190, which is really about 20 lbs. over the weight I look best at. I will probably blog more about this!</li>
<li>Get another tattoo.</li>
<li>Get out and take photographs regularly, preferably a scheduled monthly shoot.</li>
</ol>



<p>That&#8217;s a lot of resolutions, and, frankly, I&#8217;m a little intimidated by the number. But, I guess that&#8217;s the point! See you here next year to see how I did.</p>
