							<p>The hardest part of coming home isn&#8217;t the end of the adventure, or the not being alone together, or driving on the right side of the road; it&#8217;s the lack of drums. At <a href="http://lalati-fiji.com">Lalati</a>, drums tell you about everything. Happy hour? The drums will call you. Dinner? Drums! Time to go on the group snorkeling trip? You guessed it, drums. I keep on forgetting to have lunch because there&#8217;s no drums to tell me it&#8217;s lunch time, and I spend all afternoon looking forward to the 5pm happy hour drums, yet they don&#8217;t come. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003845.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Fiji, obviously, was an incredible, happy, relaxing getaway. We both came away refreshed, and eight days of just enjoying ourselves in complete indulgence was the perfect conclusion to our honeymoon. But, I have to admit, it was a little odd quite how intimate I got with the staff at <a href="http://lalati-fiji.com">Lalati Resort</a>. I mean, practically as intimate as I was with my brand new wife. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003844.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Counting down to the end of our honeymoon, we had to do something incredible to close out such an outstanding vacation. Fortunately, <a href="http://lalati-fiji.com">Lalati</a> offered just such a package, and at the outrageously low price typical of the venue &#8212; a day away at a private, secluded beach, with picnic lunch, booze, and two one-hour massages per person. Frankly, we&#8217;d been looking forward to this high point since we started to research the resort, and getting out there and getting it done was essential; being blocked by high winds on Thursday, when we&#8217;d planned to go out, only increased our determination. Friday, we finally made it, paddling our kayaks with more than a little dispatch as we worked our way to the beach even before the motorboat would have arrived to take us there. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003843.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Bula from Fiji!</h3>

							<p>Coke is made with real sugar in both New Zealand and Fiji, which, if you know me well, you know is a big priority. But there are other good things about Fiji, too. Specifically: the relaxing. And: the activities related to relaxing. And then: the activities that burn off any excess energy so that I can get back to relaxing. </p>

<p>The flip side of all this is that I&#8217;m not having much of that delicious sugar-sweetened Coke here, since, well, who needs caffeine to get in the way of that all-important relaxing? Oh, and I do apologize for the lateness of this entry, but blogging and photo editing was getting in the way of the relaxing. And, if you had the view from your veranda that I have from mine, you&#8217;d want to focus on the relaxing too. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003842.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>An Ending Fit For a Queen</h3>

							<p>So this is it&#8230; the last morning in New Zealand. Not too many tears; this afternoon we head for Fiji. We ended with four nights &#8212; our longest stop yet &#8212; in Queenstown, the premier tourist destination in New Zealand and largest city in the area. We arrived with an equal mix of exhaustion and determination to avail ourselves of the adrenalin-fueled sports the area&#8217;s famous for. Plus food, wine, fun. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003841.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Sailing Doubtful Sound</h3>

							<p>Everyone says that you need to spend time on New Zealand&#8217;s famous sounds, Milford Sound and Doubtful Sound (both of which are, in fact, fjords rather than sounds). Doubtful Sound is the more remote, difficult, and vast destination; of course, we had to go there. Of course, that meant more driving. But, fortunately, at the end of this drive was a boat, taking us through an overnight cruise far, far away from pretty much anything else in this world. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003840.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Three Days in Wanaka; Or, Finally Three Days Somewhere</h3>

							<p>While the drive to Wanaka was long, and rainy, and, worse than both, unexpectedly so, such that it sapped our energy, the fact is that Wanaka might be our favorite place in New Zealand so far. Wanaka is the red-headed stepchild of the nearby, and much more famous, Queenstown. Both towns are on a beautiful lake, both have a gold-mining history, both offer great outdoor options nearby, but Queenstown is much larger. I&#8217;m not sure about Queenstown yet, but Wanaka was beautiful, cute, filled with friendly people and good meals, and a great time all around. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003839.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Crossing New Zealand, to Punakaki and the Franz Josef Glacier</h3>

							<p>We left Christchurch driving in the opposite direction of Kaikoura, not that we were sad to do so with the rain and cold coming down from the north. Originally, the plan was to take the legendarily spectacular <a href="http://www.tranzscenic.co.nz/services/tranzalpine.aspx">TranzAlpine train</a> to cross the Southern Alps, but they&#8217;re doing track maintenance while we&#8217;re in the country, so we drove the route instead &#8212; and I can hardly imagine that it was much less spectacular. Our destination was an overnight stop at Punakaki, home of the famous Pancake Rocks, and another overnighter at the Franz Josef Glacier. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003838.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Exceedingly Non-Comprehensive Honeymoon Update, Without Photos</h3>
							<p class="date">Oct 12, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_travel.html">Travel</a></p>
						    	
							<p>One of the few things more amazing than the beauty of New Zealand&#8217;s West Coast may be the slow, expensive Internet we&#8217;ve found there so far. Thus the lack of updates. Well, that and the million things we&#8217;ve been doing on that West Coast. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003837.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Fresh off the heels of an incredible stay in Kaikoura, we headed back to Christchurch for another stay at the Hotel So, plus the chance to enjoy the city&#8217;s sights a bit. Soon we&#8217;ll be gadding about the country, doing all sorts of damn-fool things, so our last day in Christchurch has been a bit of a relaxing time for us &#8212; sleep in, have a nice breakfast, see the sights. And it&#8217;s a good thing it&#8217;s a nice, mellow day, because we barely made it here. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003836.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Based on past experience, we knew that we needed to relax, catch our breath, and get a few nights&#8217; solid sleep before we could really appreciate our honeymoon. Also based on past experience, we knew that we wouldn&#8217;t allow ourselves to make such passive choices unless there was really very little else to do <strong>and</strong> we were also in a brilliant place. That&#8217;s why we planned ourselves a nice splurge for the beginning of our honeymoon. We got out of Christchurch for a couple of days, drove north to Kaikoura, and stayed outside of town at a quiet lodge instead of our usual downtown hotel will small, reasonably-priced rooms. Specifically, we stayed in a treehouse at the <a href="http://www.hapukulodge.com/">Hapuku Lodge</a>.  Go ahead, click on that link, we might as well get the you hating me started so that we can be on the same page. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003835.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

You see, at first I didn&#8217;t feel like I had much of anything to say; then my inspiration came back, but it was joined by a new business and, most of all, by being engaged. And, if you want to find an excuse to give up all your hobbies and free time, let me tell you, getting married is it. DJ L&#8217;il Bit &#8212; now, I guess, Mrs. DJ L&#8217;il Bit! &#8212; and I spent a quick 18 weeks planning two weddings, and then we got married, and now we&#8217;re on our honeymoon, and finally I have time to say something in.

I haven&#8217;t had the time I should to get on the ol&#8217; Juniorbird.com. Which is also my way of saying that I may not post so much for the next few months either.

Cruises had popped up on our radar a few months ago; prices have been dropping dramatically as cruise lines have desperately tried to keep bookings up. Looking around for things to do for Valentine&#8217;s Day, a 4-night Carnival cruise to Catalina and Ensenada was actually so cheap as to be competitive with a nice dinner out. So I bought my honey one. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003802.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>How to Get Your Stuff Back From TSA Lost-and-Found in Los Angeles</h3>
							<p class="date">Aug 17, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_travel.html">Travel</a></p>
						    	
							<p>A couple of weeks ago I traveled to Dallas, and, due to some confusion<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003707.html#fn1">1</a></sup> managed to leave my keys at security.

							<h3>In Which I Fall Behind on My Posting 'Cause I'm Relaxing on the Beach, Suckas</h3>

							<p>I&#8217;m sorry I haven&#8217;t written! But I&#8217;ve been so, well, relaxed, and busy doing relaxing things. For instance, sleeping in. And sleeping on the beach. And sleeping next to the pool. And drinking almost every rum-based drink known to man. But I did take some pictures in between, because I care. Or, because I did wonderful things and want to make you jealous. To wit: <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003694.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>From the busy, crazy Honolulu &#8212; at least, if you ask the locals, it&#8217;s a high-stress, high-traffic place &#8212; we flew on one of those <a href="http://www.crj.bombardier.com/CRJ/en/home_crj.jsp?langId=en&amp;crjId=200">little jets made by dirty Canucks</a>, to sunny and slower Kauai. The &#8220;garden isle&#8221; of <strikethrough>Ceti Alpha 5</strikethrough> Hawaii, Kauai has a cute little airport that looks like it&#8217;s made of Lincoln Logs and is open to the air. Walking to get our rental car, we discovered that the laid-back Hertz staff had shut down for the day; but we caught a shuttle, got our car, and, despite signage that was either absent or the size of postage stamps, navigated to the hotel.<br />

							<p>Today was a very relaxing day; which was good, because we both needed it. Normally, I plan out my vacations ahead of time &#8212; learn what sites I want to see at each stop, plan out the day to make sure I hit my itinerary, and make sure my list is completed each day. But this has been a less-planned trip, and we&#8217;re trying to relax. This is what happens when two type As relax.

							<p class="date">Jul 21, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_travel.html">Travel</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I was going to the worst place in the world and I didn&#8217;t even know it yet. Weeks away and hundreds of miles up a river that snaked through the war like a main circuit cable - plugged straight into Kurtz.</p>

<p>No wait, sorry, wrong trip up the Mekong. Mine was actually kind of nice. No &#8220;terminate with extreme prejudice&#8221; or anything, although, you should be aware, this entry does not exist, nor will it ever exist.</p>

<p>After <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002696.php">Saigon</a>, my next stop was Cambodia &#8212; specifically, its capital, <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002695.php">Phnom Penh</a>, and the <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002697.php">famous ruins at Angkor Wat</a>. Now, I could fly up there, which was both quick and inexpensive (thank you Vietnam Airlines, Air Asia, and Bangkok Air!), but what fun would that be? No, I decided to take a tour up the Mekong river, seeing the sights and the local minority peoples and drinking with other English-speaking tourists. Yes, it promised to be a bang-up time. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002703.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

That&#8217;s right, I survived four hours of flying from Bangkok to Taipei &#8212; including an unexpected and free upgrade to business class &#8212; followed by a five-hour layover in Taipei, capped off with an eleven hour flight home (it was supposed to be twelve, but I guess we caught a tailwind, which was good since it took an hour for my bag to come off the plane). <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002702.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Chiang Mai is a small city in Northern Thailand, but Thais seem to think of it like their second city. I came here because it&#8217;s in the hills, and I thought I&#8217;d like a little cool weather to end my vacation. The weather has been quite reasonable for this area, although of course with the humidity of the jungle. Yesterday, I tromped about town &#8212; it only takes a half hour to walk from one end of the old walled city to the other &#8212; visitng as many of the city&#8217;s old and beautiful wats, or Buddhist temples, as possible.  <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002699.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Until today, I had, in all honesty, been disappointed by the food I&#8217;d had in Cambodia. Khmer cuisine was supposed to be the undiscovered jewel, but it had seemed bland compared to Thai cuisine, which was spicier, or Vietnamese cuisine, which was more flavorful. And then I got a cookie on the street, and had dinner at what is purported to be Mick Jagger&#8217;s favorite place in Siem Reap. That Mick, he&#8217;s a smart man. Oh, and I also saw that wonder of the world, Angkor Wat, etc. etc. etc. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002697.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

That was before I took a boat ride down Hu&eacute;&#8217;s Perfume river and visited the tombs of the Nguyen emperors.

							<p>The lack of <a href="http://engrish.com/">Engrish</a> t-shirts in Vietnam is making it hard for me to find funny blog titles, but I do think I hit some sort of Hanoi trifecta today: I saw Uncle Ho&#8217;s mausoleum, the Army museum, and had dessert with a hooker. It doesn&#8217;t get much better than that! Except for &#8212; and I will admit this freely, because sometimes giving bad things a name makes them less bad &#8212; it is preposterously hot here.<br />

							<p>Hanoi is ridiculously beautiful, although there are a few problems. One is that the street my hotel is on shares a name with two other streets, just the tones vary between the three names. So I tried to meet up w/some people a friend knows who live here, and I texted my address,  but since I coudn&#8217;t include the accents that specify the tones, they had to track down which of the streets I live on. But we met up, and went out. The other unfortunateness is the Vietnamese currency, named the Dong. Not only is its name a silly schoolyard bad word, but it&#8217;s also in cartoon-large bill sizes. The smallest is 1000 dong, and, at 15,000 to the dollar, that&#8217;s not much. So I took out just a little money but I have a massive roll in my pocket: <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002683.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

I has a <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/001619.php">great trip</a> there, and I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed the photos at least 10% as much as I enjoyed taking them. What follows is photos of the ruins of the ancient Aztec <em>Templo Mayor</em>, the center of life in old Tenochtitlan.

							<p>One of Mexico&#8217;s most famous recent monuments (that is, excepting the Aztec and Maya ruins) is the <em>Ninos Heroes</em> in the <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/001619.php">Bosque de Chapultepec</a>. It&#8217;s a very proud monument for such a sad story. I&#8217;ve done my best to take proud, nationalist photos of it, despite being from the nation that inspired the cadets&#8217; <em>jette&eacute;</em>. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001775.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

It&#8217;s a bizarre hodgepodge of various styles of architecture, with components obviously built by experienced military men with an eye for a defensive position, and components built imitating the styles of the grand French chateaux. The Castillo has a great view of the whole city and is definitely where I&#8217;ll make my home, when I&#8217;m king. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001766.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>The <em>Bosque</em>, or forest, is a large area, around a hill, that has stood green since the time of the Aztecs, and which held the rulers of Mexico City from the time of the Conquistadors to well after the Revolution.

Oh, and for some balance there&#8217;s two pictures from a street that was filled with hookers. Not that I took any pictures of the hookers. Just of the street on which the hookers sat. Frankly, Rio hookers scared me. There&#8217;s probably a future blog entry on that. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001740.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I&#8217;ve been traveling a lot lately, and there&#8217;s a certain set of my fellow travelers who stand out. It&#8217;s not the people with kids, or the businessmen in their suits, or the harried wives dragging along irresponsible husbands who have no idea how to manage any complex task in their lives apart from golf, it&#8217;s not even the four rows of people behind me on an earlier flight who were obviously related because all four generations of these blondes had exactly the same hairstyle. No, it&#8217;s the people with the bags, those two large wheel-on bags that the rest of us check and that they, somehow, have the gumption to try to squeeze into the overhead compartments. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001645.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<h3>Getting Back Up To Speed</h3>
							<p class="date">Jun 30, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_travel.html">Travel</a></p>
						    	
							<p>When I was in Brazil, I frequently was <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/001535.html">stuck sitting in the front seat of cabs</a>. For some strange reason, even though the cabs were tiny, even though all of them had some major instrument out of service (speedometer, fuel, or, in one case a functional-but-not-useful generic turn indicator that flashed a two-headed arrow whenever the driver signalled), even though the cabs were all driven at a high rate of speed, even though the cabs followed too close, didn&#8217;t attend to the lanes painted on the road, and even though the cabs just blew through red lights after dark, I never was particularly scared. And, yes, I took the cabs before I got drinking too. But, today, taking a cab from the Mexico City airport to <a href="http://www.caminoreal.com/">my hotel</a>. I was scared out of my gourd. Clutching the hanging front-seat seatbelt for dear life. Staring at my feet so that I didn&#8217;t have to look out the window at my onrushing doom. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001614.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I&#8217;m very happy that I took the time to learn a little bit of Portuguese before traveling to Brazil. Having the ability to understand, and to communicate with, many of the people I met there really improved my trip. Of course, it also got me stuck riding in the front of cabs and talking to cabbies, so it wasn&#8217;t all upside. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001535.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>So there was this flu-like thing that was making its way slowly through the whole <span class="caps">PRIME </span>group; I got it two weeks ago. Fortunately it only lasted a day and a half (as compared to up to a week for other people), but, as soon as I felt better, I went out for <em>churrascaria</em> and several caipirhinas, and that was pushing it too hard; the flu turned into a stomach thing that laid me up for most of another day. So, today I took it easy, walking down Copacabana beach to the beautiful Fort Copacabana. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001513.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Today I made a mistake. We went to the Vinos Concha y Toro vineyard, and I thought we&#8217;d be there just for meetings and speeches; instead, we got a tour of the whole complex. And me not with my camera! So there will be no photos of Concha y Toro. Nor will there be &#8212; and I doubt you&#8217;ll be unhappy about this &#8212; any photos of the teams presenting to Bice Bank or Banco Santander Santiago. (Yes, we are here to give real actual consulting presentations!) <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001507.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Santiago PRIME, Day 2</h3>

							<p>Santiago is very European town; it could pass for a French or Spanish city, with parts of historical beauty and parts of awful &#8217;80s architecture and parts of deteriorating &#8217;50s concrete buildings. The people are also very European, with only, apparently, the road workers and cooks showing much Indian ethnic background. This makes for a very different feel than most of Latin America &#8212; especially Mexico, to which I&#8217;m somewhat used &#8212; and it means that Santiago mostly lacks the &#8220;exotic&#8221; women I typically go for. Also, it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m all that, but I&#8217;m kind of used to the Mexican women checking me out. In fact, I&#8217;ve been hit on even in front of the Wonderful Girlfriend. Maybe it&#8217;s the camera around my neck, or the little memo pad in which I take notes, or the not-in-style clothes, but the women in Santiago won&#8217;t even make eye contact. Apart from that, this town is a ton of fun. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001506.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
