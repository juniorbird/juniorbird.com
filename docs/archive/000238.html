				<p>Since the beginning of this process I&#8217;ve felt like I was behind. Most of the folks I know who have decided to go to business school were learning about getting their <span class="caps">MBA </span>for a year or more before their applications became due; I only decided to embark upon this journey two months ago.</p>
				
				<p>But today I received external validation that I&#8217;m on schedule or maybe even a little ahead. I&#8217;ve started calling schools to set up campus visits, so that I can meet students and see classes at a few of the places I might be interested in attending. Feeling behind, I strongly suspected that I&#8217;d be one of the last people to call and set up a visit; but instead, I found that the schools are, by and large, not yet ready for me! One, for instance, didn&#8217;t start holding visits until October 20th; another hadn&#8217;t released the list of classes I&#8217;d be able to attend.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s nice to know I&#8217;m on schedule, but it&#8217;s important to not let up and fall behind. I&#8217;ve still got a lot to do, so let&#8217;s get to it!</p>
