				<p>Today, you can read this entry at <a href="http://wadearmstrong.com">http://wadearmstrong.com</a>. In a few days (or, if I&#8217;m not being so productive, weeks), it&#8217;ll be pushed off the front page and into an archive page, when it will be found at an address like <a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/000316.html">http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/000316.html</a>. Links that went to the first address will start being, well, lies, since the referred content will no longer be there. And what use is that on the internet? </p>
				
				<p>Apparently, not much. Every day, information is lost because links &#8220;rot&#8221; and either start pointing to different content or no content at all (the dreaded &#8220;error 404&#8221;). We&#8217;re not just talking broken links on My First Webpage; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A8730-2003Nov23.html">real professionals and researchers are using Web sites in footnotes and reference lists</a>. Links are rotting at a rate of up to 15% in one year and 50% in four years.</p>

<p>Links rot because of how <span class="caps">URL</span>s point to resources. In http://www.wadearmstrong.com/archives/000316.html you have the protocol used to connect (http://), the domain name (wadearmstrong.com), the specific server to connect to (www), the folder on that server to look in (/archives/), the page to look for (000316), and the type of file that page is (.html). A lot of that information is redundant, a lot once was stylish to include at one time or another, and therefore a lot can be removed. For instance, most Web browsers will assume the http://. The www is &#8212; and this may come as a surprise to many &#8212; <a href="http://no-www.org/">also redundant</a>. In most cases the file type is unnecessary as well &#8212; is there any difference between a static .html page and a dynamically-generated .php or .asp one? Not to the Web browser, which must ultimately show the information on the page, but changing a page&#8217;s name from 000316.html to 000316.py will break any link to that page. <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI.html">Some folks</a> suggest getting rid of the file type, which is easy to do with most Web servers.</p>

<p>So I could fix the <span class="caps">URL </span>of this page to http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/000316 (or even the more useful http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/urls). But will that help the linkrot problem? Only to a moderate extent. Suppose I decide to buy a new domain name &#8212; this page might move to http://example.com/archives/urls because I like the new domain name better. </p>

<p>There are a few ways to find a page that has totally disappeared. You can check out <a href="http://archive.org">http://archive.org</a>, a site that saves old pages. Google maintains a &#8220;cache&#8221;: http://www.google.com/help/features.html#cached of how pages looked the last time they were visited. These are both convenient, but there&#8217;s no guarantee that any page will be saved. <span class="caps">URL</span>s are not unique or guaranteed; &#8220;URNs&#8221; http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt are. Not that anybody uses <span class="caps">URN</span>s. Domain names (like wadearmstrong.com) could conceivably be supplemented by <a href="http://www.issn.org:8080/English/pub/"><span class="caps">ISSN</span>s</a>. But who would want to visit a Web site with the <span class="caps">URL </span>issn://231982331698763/archives/url? Or, even worse, <span class="caps">URN</span>:wadearmstrong:foo:47? Nope, I like my vanity domain.</p>

<p>Vanity domains are all well and fine for scribblings like this, but what of the mission-critical links mentioned at the beginning? A lost reference in a scientific article can throw the conclusions of that paper into doubt. A central registry, using ugly-looking identifiers like the ones above, may be well-suited as a tool to maintain permanent links to important documents; authors could pay a small fee to enter the <span class="caps">URL </span>of their document in the registry and then keep it updated manually. Authors citing these documents could then use the registry address &#8212; for instance, registry://w/a/47/aurngeyw/123756 &#8212; in cites, and be assured that this identifier would forward to http://harvard.edu/mypaper/mypaper.htm or http://nsa.gov/research/4747.asp or to wherever the document travels.</p>

<p>Somebody should take out a patent!</p>
