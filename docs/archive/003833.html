				<p>The <em>Top Chef</em> of your dreams may involve outrageous ingredients, inspired chefs, and aggressive, coolly-confident characters; mine apparently involves chefs marooned in space. In my dream <em>Top Chef</em>, the contestants, Tom Colicchio, Padma Lakshmi, and me, were all sent out to a far-away planet, along with a shipful of miners and farmers and builders, to establish a new colony (Gail Simmons had her own ship and went back to Earth between episodes). The winning chef would be the head chef at a brand-new luxury resort on a distant continent; the losing chefs would all be sent off, together, to colonize another planet. </p>

<p>Our trip to the new planet only took a few months, although we were all jammed pretty well together in our small staterooms on the spaceship <a href="http://www.scificool.com/images/2008/09/battle-beyond-the-stars-2.jpg">Nell, from Battle Beyond the Stars</a>. When we landed, we found a world of tangled jungle vines around ancient trees, with sunny clearings in between. The chefs were set up in one clearing, living in mobile home-like structures we&#8217;d brought along; a few clearings away, the construction workers had begun to build a city around the base of a giant tree. A third clearing was paved over so that Gail Simmons&#8217;s faster-than-light Space Shuttle could spirit her in and out quickly, so that she wouldn&#8217;t be stuck doing her own makeup and looking like she did in that Western challenge last week.</p>

<p>I stayed on Nell, making sure that any essential supplies &#8212; non-stick pans, foie gras, insect repellant &#8212; were sent down. Every time a chef was eliminated, I sent a shuttle down to get them, then set them up in an escape pod and shot the escape pod into orbit around our new planet. At the end of the season, I chained all of the escape pods together, hooked them to a shuttle, and sent them on a year-long trip to a new, remote planet &#8212; the planet of the chefs. I hoped they all got along, because they&#8217;d have no-one but each other to keep company out there! Although I did know we&#8217;d sent ahead all the materials and ingredients to build and open a number of lovely, fully-equipped restaurants there.</p>
