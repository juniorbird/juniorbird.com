							<h3>Salmon with Asian Pesto</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov 23, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_food.html">Food</a>, <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_photos.html">Photos</a></p>
						    	
							<p>With all the <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003702.html">basil from the housewarming party</a>, I could hardly resist making all manner of pesto. The Thai basil basically dared me to make an Asian-flavored pesto, and, once made, the perfect match was clearly a simple grilled salmon. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003758.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Quantum of Solace</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov 15, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_reviews.html">Reviews</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Let&#8217;s face it, the Bond franchise had fallen to a pretty low place before <em>Casino Royale</em> &#8212; it had become a series of nearly-unwatchable flicks that drew an audience only because of the woman in the bikini or the gadgets on the car. So I was more than a little worried that <em>Quantum of Solace</em> would turn back towards the bad old days. Fortunately, it didn&#8217;t; <em>Quantum of Solace</em> is a tight, gritty action flick that highlights Daniel Craig&#8217;s sociopathic take on Bond. Sadly, it also has big action montages that make no sense. Most of all, if you like a good movie, and you live in <span class="caps">LA, </span>it&#8217;s worth going to see <em>Quantum of Solace</em> at the Century City mall just to check out their new parking lot system. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003770.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Peanutty Tofu & Cabbage Asian Salad</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov  9, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_food.html">Food</a>, <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_photos.html">Photos</a></p>
						    	
							<p>The summer just won&#8217;t quit here in Southern California, which means summery dishes even as the night comes sooner. A good Asian salad is a great weekend lunch or light weeknight dinner, and this recipe is pretty low-fat and responsible. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003759.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Homemade Margaritas</h3>

							<p>One of the benefits of living in California is the year-round summer. That means every day is a great day for a Margarita, and, with a lemon tree in our backyard, that means homemade sour mix for those Margaritas! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003757.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Grilled Pesto Flatbread</h3>

							<p>Pizza&#8217;s great, and with all the great basil we got for our <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003702.html">housewarming</a>, a pizza with pesto replacing the marinara seemed obvious. The <span class="caps">AIG </span>also has this great, old, well-seasoned grill pan that we use for just about everything, so grilling the pizza sure sounded fun. Thus, super-adult, super-fun, grilled pesto flatbread! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003756.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Delicious Meatless Low-Carb Lasagna</h3>

							<p>Healthy cooking can be fun. So can unhealthy eating! Everybody loves a good lasagna, but that Italian delectable is filled with fat and calories and not exactly great for the &#8216;ol ticker. So we whipped up a meatless, cheeseless, low-carb, and otherwise trend-compliant version, semi only because we added a bit of Pecorino for some richness. It came out light and delicious! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003755.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
							
							<h3>We Mean Business: Berry Elegance</h3>

							<p>This week, the We Mean Business team takes on <a href="http://berryelegance.com/">Berry Elegance</a>, a store that makes berries and other desserts dipped in chocolate. Berry Elegance is stalled, with sales falling short and the two owners in disagreement on how to run the business. </p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/entrepreneurship/we_mean_business_berry_elegance.php">Read on&#8230;</a>

							<h3>Why is it That a Pet Almost Dies at Every Party I Hold?</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov  1, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_photos.html">Photos</a>, <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_will_somebody_please_explain_to_me.html">Will Somebody Please Explain To Me...</a></p>
						    	
							<p>So at the <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003702.html">Housewarming Party</a> the <a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/gallery/3054487_JzRG2/1/166319766_anwr9">dog</a> walked out the front door, took a left turn, and went absentmindedly exploring down the block. A neighbor a few houses down fortunately recognized him and came by carrying the little guy. Let me tell you that finding a black dog in the middle of the night did not sound like a good bet at the time and we were sure happy to see the pup. Then, as we were setting up for last night&#8217;s combined Halloween/AIG&#8217;s Birthday party, a <a href="http://identify.whatbird.com/obj/36/_/Coopers_Hawk.aspx">Cooper&#8217;s Hawk</a> suddenly swept down from the sky gunning straight for <a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/gallery/1437283_4rCYr/1/68344502_yTuCP">Junior</a>. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003745.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
