				<p>When I was preparing to take the <span class="caps">SAT, </span>one of the most important things I learned from my Princeton Review prep book was how to spot the trick questions and answers in that test. My Princeton Review <span class="caps">GMAT </span>prep book is doing the same thing, and I think it will be very helpful. With many of the wrong answers in the test designed to look &#8220;right&#8221;, it&#8217;s important to know how to spot these answers and stay away from them.</p>
				
				<p>I&#8217;m also learning good tricks to find the answers to math problems. I spent way too much time on a few problems during the practice test, and these tricks all help me shortcut certain time-consuming mathematical tasks.</p>

<p>Until about sixth grade, I performed awfully on standardized tests; some of my teachers even wanted to send me back a grade because of my scores. In junior high I learned a lot about being a better test-taker, including how to pay attention to the question being asked. But, doing my review work, I find myself skipping over parts of problems and therefore getting the answers wrong. It&#8217;s disappointing, but I think it&#8217;s a consequence of the work I&#8217;ve been doing for the past few years. I deal with problems every day &#8212; but they&#8217;re not already-defined problems; I have to define them myself. So I think it&#8217;s unfamiliar to me to have to work with already-defined problems. Oh well, practice practice practice will fix that!</p>
