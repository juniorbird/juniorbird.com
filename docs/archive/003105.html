				<p>I am Annoyed Consumer. The people at Blue Cross &#8212; normally I would say fine people, but not in this case &#8212; have raised my rates. Now, I&#8217;m aware that there&#8217;s this thing called &#8220;inflation&#8221; and this other thing called &#8220;progress&#8221; and that, sometimes, these conspire to make health insurance premiums go up. But somehow I don&#8217;t think that a 20% increase is representative of the core health care inflation rate.</p>

<p>In fact, apparently, in 2006, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15014332/">healthcare rates for businesses increased by 7.7%</a>. Why is the rate increase for me nearly three times the rate increase for businesses? It doesn&#8217;t make sense &#8212; in fact, I&#8217;d think it should be the opposite. For plans provided to businesses, insurance companies must accept some members who aren&#8217;t in good health, just because of who they work for. In contrast, when choosing individual plan members, the insurance companies have shown a preference to <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-insure28nov28,0,2548282,full.story?coll=la-home-headlines-">cherry</a>&#8220;pick&#8221;:http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-reject8jan08,0,6430685,full.story?coll=la-home-headlines. While I&#8217;m in no way in favor of this practice &#8212; in fact, I think it&#8217;s best for everyone if insurers cover the largest risk pools possible &#8212; logically, it should result in the ultra-exclusive inidividual insurance being the cheapest of all.</p>

<p>And it&#8217;s not as if I&#8217;ve moved into some big new risk pool. I&#8217;m closer to 32, sure, but I don&#8217;t know that 31 1/2 is some famous dividing line between &#8220;young and resilient&#8221; and &#8220;old and fragile.&#8221; I haven&#8217;t gotten sick, haven&#8217;t gotten any medical treatments lately, all I did in the last six months was get a checkup and an immunization booster. That&#8217;s not cost-increase-worthy.</p>

<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m not a big fan of my 20% boost. In fact, I really don&#8217;t want to pay it. And I don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s reasonable that I should accept worse coverage. My ideal outcome is that I&#8217;d pay 7-10% more this year than I did last, which seems to be in line with overall health cost inflation, and is a fair rate increase.</p>

<p>So, who can I complain to about this to fight my increase? Insurance commissioner? City councilperson? Congressman? &#8216;Cause I&#8217;m ready to fight. </p>
