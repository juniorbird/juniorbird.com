				<p>I went downtown with the Art Society of Marshall today, on a tour of <a href="http://www.laconservancy.org/tours/tours_main.php4#broadway">the LA skyline</a>. We were accompanied, on the early part of our tour, by an escort of downtown&#8217;s finest; that is to say, an African-American homeless man pushing a shopping cart full of flattened cardboard boxes. This worthy was clearly trying to inform us of some of the more subtle things around us: &#8220;smells like poo!&#8221; he&#8217;d yell, at the top of his lungs. &#8220;Smells like poo?&#8221; &#8220;SMELLS like poo!&#8221; The inflection varied between outbursts, almost as if he was trying to say different things (just like Junior can mean three different things when he says &#8220;hello!&#8221;).</p>

<p>But we ignored the poor man, and finally he sat down on a bench in front of <a href="http://www.standardhotel.com/">The Standard</a> and played his harmonica. Well, the one note he knew how to hit on his harmonica he played for while. When that didn&#8217;t get our attention, he stormed up to the curb, kicked a McDonald&#8217;s bag into the street with much gusto, and yelled, at the top of his lungs, &#8220;that&#8217;s my black ass!&#8221;</p>

<p>Much more unnerving was the woman parked near me at night. I went to meet some friends for a bite to eat; we met in Beverly Hills. I found street parking on a dark street (Burton Way, actually a 4-lane thoroughfare, but pretty dark nonetheless) and, getting out of my car, walked up to the &#8220;No Parking&#8221; sign to discern exactly when there was No Parking. I was interrupted in the middle of the sign (&#8220;No Parking 6am to&#8230; wha?&#8221;) by a scream behind me, &#8220;get the hell out of here!&#8221; Turns out that there was a woman sitting in the darkened car next to the &#8220;No Parking&#8221; sign and this strange man standing outside her car freaked her out. I tried to explain that I was deciphering the &#8220;No Parking&#8221; sign but she just gave me the evil eye. Now, being nervous I can understand but, in Beverly Hills? Her scream was so bloodcurdling, my heart was pounding for minutes afterwards. Now <em>that</em> smelled like poo!</p>
