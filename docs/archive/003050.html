				<p>Thanks for hosting another year&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s Rockin&#8217; Eve last night. I really appreciate you coming out and announcing the events of the evening, with the help of Ryan Seacrest, of course. And I really appreciate all of the execs who convinced you to come on TV again, despite the fact that your stroke gave you a massive speech impediment. And I&#8217;d like to thank you for that speech impediment, because imitating it was definitely a great way to get laughs from a very drunk crowd.</p>

<p>Of course, it was really nice to see you on screen, just where I expected you &#8212; counting down to the New Year. You&#8217;ve been doing that since before I was born and I&#8217;ll admit that I kind of dreaded seeing the inevitable replacement for you<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003050.html#fn1">1</a></sup> trying to fill your shoes.  Then I heard you speak. Now, who let you out sounding like that? Your smooth baritone, so in control, so above the fray, so enthusiastic &#8212; it was gone. Replaced, as it were, by a more cosmopolitan Rocky Balboa. </p>

<p>Sure, you were a lot better than last year, but it was like watching Andre Agassi with no forehand &#8212; you can beat me any day, but you probably shouldn&#8217;t be out there against the Pete Samprases of this world. Couldn&#8217;t you, you know, stick to exhibition matches? Stand next to the Seacrest-bot and do just the countdown?</p>

<p>And which of your advisors and family members thought this was a good idea anyway? It&#8217;s not like you need the money. Why should you get out there, tire yourself out, and perform below your own expectations? I mean, apart from in order to give us a chance to mock your new mumble. Like I said, you pointed me toward the laughs.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll admit I&#8217;m worried about you, Dick. Are you sure that stroke didn&#8217;t really hurt you? I mean, Seacrest? Seriously? It says great that you&#8217;re progressive enough to hire somebody with that lifestyle,<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003050.html#fn2">2</a></sup> but couldn&#8217;t you pick someone with talent? Or body hair? Don&#8217;t you have an agent who&#8217;s supposed to look out for those who are trying to exploit you?<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003050.html#fn3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>After all this time, what you really deserve, Dickie my boy, is to put up your feet and watch the ball drop from home, with a nice glass of Champagne<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003050.html#fn4">4</a></sup> in your hand. That&#8217;s much better than being the mealy-mouthed punch line for my jokes, however much I need the other people at my party to believe that I&#8217;m funny. Oh, won&#8217;t somebody please believe that I&#8217;m funny?<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003050.html#fn5">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>Wade</p>
