				<p>One of the best uses of my time this year was the <a href="http://www.marshall.usc.edu/clubs/GMA.cfm?doc_id=3557">Graduate Marketing Association&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.marshall.usc.edu/clubs/GMA.cfm?doc_id=3596">Marketing Institute</a>. I&#8217;ll admit, I was pretty skeptical at first; the <span class="caps">GMA </span>has a reputation for being very <a href="http://business.acronymfinder.com/af-query.asp?string=exact&amp;acronym=cpg"><span class="caps">CPG</span>-oriented</a>, and I&#8217;ve publicly declaimed my tech marketing orientation. After a week of midterms and Strategy projects, the 5:45 wakeup for six hours of presentations didn&#8217;t seem like the most fun. Happily I was proven quite wrong!</p>

<p>There were a few particularly good speakers, one of whom fortunately presented first. <a href="http://www.marshall.usc.edu/media/mag_s_04/profile_pollack.pdf">Greg Pollack</a> from <a href="http://pbmmarketing.com/index2.html"><span class="caps">PBM</span> Marketing</a>. In my first job, at <a href="http://marmillion.com">Pacific Visions</a>, we built strategic partnerships between government and non-profits; <span class="caps">PBM </span>marketing does the same for commercial entities. It was fun to think that something I understood could be applied in more ways then I&#8217;d known.</p>

<p>But that wasn&#8217;t the speaker that made the most impact on me. <a href="http://www.nestleusa.com/pressRoom/pressReleases/pressRelease.asp?id=200491154645208111343">Rusty Ortiz</a> from Nestle really blew me away. He was a personable man himself, but what was important was the story he told; for the first time, brand management and <span class="caps">CPG </span>sounded like a good idea.</p>

<p>In all of my jobs since <span class="caps">PVC,</span> I&#8217;ve been a bit dissatisfied that we in marketing were running to catch up with everybody else in their departments. We couldn&#8217;t drive what happened; we could only follow. But, in <span class="caps">CPG, </span>marketing is the driver. Rusty told fascinating stories of moving brands forward with thoughtful consideration, of being in the driver&#8217;s seat, of being able to look into the consumer and act on what&#8217;s out there.</p>

<p>An earlier speaker, Nancy Zwiers of <a href="http://www.funosophy.com/">Funosophy</a>, made a very cogent distinction between marketing-driven companies and sales-driven companies. Sales-driven companies look for marketing to change sales numbers; marketing-driven companies use marketing as a lens through which to see the world, and marketing drives planning and sales. What marketing wouldn&#8217;t want to work in a marketing-driven company? Nestle &#8212; and Dial, for which Rusty had earlier worked &#8212; seemed just that kind of a place.</p>

<p>A few speakers after Rusty came Ned Ward from Mattel. Now, when a toy designer gets up to speak you know you&#8217;re going to have a good time, and Ned didn&#8217;t disappoint. Funny, with great stories, Ned again showed the value of working at a marketing-driven company.</p>

<p>There were other speakers, and they were all good; but Rusty and Ned, and, to a lesser extent, Nancy, turned me around completely on <span class="caps">CPG.</span> I&#8217;ll certainkly be seriously considering a <span class="caps">CPG </span>internship for the summer, probably more seriously than an internship in tech marketing. Yes, those were six well-spent hours.</p>
