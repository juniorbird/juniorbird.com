				<p>Okay, so it&#8217;s Fall Back time; we all get an extra hour of sleep Sunday morning, and now we get to enjoy the cold, still dark that comes in winter evenings. Well, we could if we didn&#8217;t live in Southern California. But I digress. Birds, now, birds know nothing of these Daylight Savings Time changes. All they do know is that sometimes they&#8217;re tired and testy, and sometimes they&#8217;re ready to eat breakfast and get the day started.</p>

<p>That means that Daylight Savings Time gives me two hard weeks a year. Every spring, Junior gets woken up early and put to bed early; in revenge, he spends a good hour climbing around his cage, stomping around and clanging on the metal bars every evening until he gets used to the new schedule. In the fall, like now, he&#8217;s ready to get up early in the morning &#8212; it&#8217;s the same clanging and stomping, just now waking me up in the morning, not keeping me up at night &#8212; and then he&#8217;s cranky throughout the whole late evening.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s important to understand that an <a href="http://www.birdsnways.com/cockatoo/umb.htm">Umbrella Cockatoo</a> is, basically, a two-year-old, and, like any other two-year-old, misbehaves when <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/expert/toddler/toddlersleep/13280.html">overtired</a>. It starts with relentlessly adorable beahvior at about 10pm (his usual bedtime is 11:30, or 10:30 given the Daylight Savings change). He&#8217;ll start talking sweetly and quietly, saying &#8220;pretty white bird&#8221; and making kissing noises, but he won&#8217;t cuddle; he&#8217;ll walk to the far side of his tree-shaped perch in the middle of the living room and flirt from there.</p>

<p>About a half hour later he&#8217;ll start making his complaining noise &#8212; a grating groan from the back of his throat &#8212; and, if he has any energy left, he&#8217;ll lean forward, extend his wings slightly, and bounce up and down &#8212; typical begging behavior. Of course, he&#8217;s not begging for anything in specific, just to somehow be relieved of his worries. If I pick him up and try to take him to his cage, he&#8217;ll resist getting in and climb onto my shoulder. If I pick him up and try to sit with him on my lap, he&#8217;ll look at me with suspicion-filled, slitted eyes, then nibble on everything within reach. I like my stuff and don&#8217;t need little triangular beak-shaped holes in it. Well, in the it what doesn&#8217;t have little triangular beak-shaped holes in it already.</p>

<p>And whatever he does, he&#8217;ll sit there and say &#8220;good bird!&#8221; every few minutes until it&#8217;s bedtime, asking for reassurance that he is, in fact, a good bird. And he is, a sweet and good bird, and, in another week, he&#8217;ll even be a pleasant bird, sitting on my lap, wanting kisses and scratchies, and falling asleep nestled under my arm, until he finally goes into his cage, is covered with a blanket, and goes to bed, sleeping soundly until he comes out in the morning ready to kiss and cuddle. Now that&#8217;s the life a Cockatoo understands, not this time change thing.</p>
