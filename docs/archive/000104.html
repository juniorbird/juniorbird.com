				<p>Earlier today I ran to Staples for some fax toner. After circling a couple of times, I found a spot in their very packed parking lot. Then i drove about 20 seconds to move to the <span class="caps">OSH </span>parking lot, to pick up gardening items. I had to switch spots, you see, because the two adjacent stores had nearly adjacent, (far too small) parking lots, with prominently placed &#8220;Tow Away- Customer Parking Only&#8221; signs. I didn&#8217;t want to get towed, you know.</p>

<p>One nice thing about malls &#8212; even strip malls &#8212; is that you don&#8217;t need to worry about parking, you just park. Now, I&#8217;m definitely not in favor of the strip mallization of the world, but they do have the right idea about parking. Suppose <span class="caps">OSH </span>and Staples and Lamps Plus got together and built a single parking structure? It would be pretty inexpensive split three ways. And then imagine that each person who&#8217;d gone to one of the stores thought about making a quick visit to one of the others? If each store got just 5% of the customers going to other stores to come in and make an impulse purchase, that&#8217;s a lot of money!</p>

<p>With the proliferation of &#8220;big box&#8221; stores, this kind of cooperative action may make more sense than it did in the past. In urban areas, you just can&#8217;t find the large open space that developers use to make strip malls for the big box stores. Then you get situations like the one I encountered today, too many stores with too many small parking lots, all near each other. If all the stores got together and developed just a little parking structure, well, customers will shop at more than one store.</p>

<p>Cities could do this &#8212; and often do &#8212; but companies should also think about making an investment in parking. It&#8217;s got a potential big payoff, if customers who would otherwise move their cars do just a little bit of impulse shopping..</p>
