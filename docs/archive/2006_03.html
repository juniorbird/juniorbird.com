							<p>In my professor&#8217;s lecture. She&#8217;s a batty Britisher, smart as all get-out but a bit flaky. Her classes are nutty but informative.

							<p>Thank you for providing me with that little shot of adrenalin this morning; it was a rainy, dismal morning, and I was a little groggy. Seeing you speed through the red light, and feeling my car skid just a bit as I slammed on the breaks in the wet street, stopping just feet from you, certainly got me going at peak alertness. I hope that I didn&#8217;t disrupt your cell phone conversation too much when I laid on my horn while coming to a complete stop (said action was refreshingly reflexive). <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002452.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Oh maaaan, I had the wildest spring break. I went craaaazy, all out, no holds barred, put it all on the line. That&#8217;s right, my spring break was oooooouuuuuuut of control! Yeah, like a major playa, I stayed home and worked on research and planning for my new business, that&#8217;s hardcore, dude. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002430.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<h3>Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Starting a Poker Company</h3>
							<p class="date">Mar 16, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_elsewhere.html">Elsewhere</a></p>
							
							<p>Are you one of those people who have become, in the last 2-3 years, fascinated with poker? Are you one of the people who have become, in the last 2-3 years, jealous of the fact that major companies have been built to mechanically suction money from consumers&#8217; wallets using a new fascination with poker? Then you might want to read my new entry at WadeArmstrong.com on <a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/entrepreneurship/poker_and_effec.php">the World Poker Tour&#8217;s founder, Steve Lipscomb</a>. Or not. Because who loves the stuff I write anyway?</p><a href="Are you one of those people who have become, in the last 2-3 years, fascinated with poker?

							<p>I have a confession to make, a confession that will make you lose all sympathy for me. A confession that will draw away any residual extent to which you identify with me. A confession that will ensure that you label me, henceforth, as a freak. Aargh. I can barely admit it. <span class="caps">OK, </span>here I go.</p>

							<h3>What's All the Ruckus About? (A Review of the Ruckus Music Service)</h3>

							<p><span class="caps">USC </span>offers one of those subscription-based music services, <a href="http://ruckus.com">Ruckus</a>, for just $10/semester to its students. I&#8217;m a cheap-ass motherfucker and $10 hits that cheap-ass spot just right, so I signed up. Heck, it&#8217;s a standard <a href="http://www.playsforsure.com/">Microsoft-based music rental service</a>, so I also thought it would be a fun idea to check and see if I would like renting, rather than <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">buying</a> my music (at least I&#8217;d get to write a review!). The conclusion? The rental model demands an incredibly high level of execution &#8212; a level that&#8217;s absent &#8212; and is uncompelling at the moment. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002410.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I barely made it through the day today. For the past couple of weeks, my laptop had been occasionally resistant to starting up, and today it finally showed it was serious, refusing to start all morning long. Anybody who has spent time with me knows I&#8217;m practically surgically attached to my computer. Well, midterms start Monday and I have little higher brain function without my laptop, so emergency surgery was required. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002344.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
