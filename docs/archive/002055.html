				<p>Thanks for taking my trash can from directly in front of my house. It sure was unsightly, especially since it was black and my house is white; the contrast was just awful. Thank goodness it&#8217;s gone now! If only I just had some place to put my trash, my kitchen garbage is sure getting full!</p>

<p>Now, <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000970.php">last year when you took my trash can</a> you took it from in front of my driveway, which I can understand; it sure must be tempting seeing a trash can just sitting out there (although I&#8217;m not sure why you chose mine out of all of those out for trash day). This year, however, you actually took the can from in front of my house &#8212; ignoring the neighbor&#8217;s can sitting out at the end of the alley. I&#8217;m not quite sure what made my can more attractive, but, hey, I realize that, if you&#8217;re going to do it, you&#8217;ve got to get the good stuff. No point in going halfway.</p>

<p>I am still confused as to what the particular attraction of a stolen trash can is. Most houses can get one or two for free; extra ones are just a one-time flat fee. Can you really provide a stolen can for a price much cheaper than a legitimate can? Won&#8217;t the trash company realize that there&#8217;s an illicit extra can in front of the property?</p>

<p>Or maybe not! Maybe there&#8217;s some phone number on some telephone pole somewhere that I&#8217;ve missed advertising &#8220;cheap trash cans.&#8221; Maybe there&#8217;s a large, illict market for illicit trash cans in Beverly Hills so that the rich people don&#8217;t need to show restraint in throwing out their trash? Is there a unmet demand in South <span class="caps">LA, </span>where the trash people won&#8217;t go to leave new trash cans off, so they need the stolen cans? I mean, I know it&#8217;s not my neighbors, because they have dumpsters &#8212; or, maybe, does a hot can make people feel special, like homeowners, or, at least, residents of smaller apartments?</p>

<p>Either way, I called up the <span class="caps">DWP </span>and I&#8217;m getting a new free can on Monday. But I&#8217;ll wonder, every time I look at my new can, where my old one is, and how I can get into this happening stolen trash can market, because I&#8217;m a born businessman, yo, and I want in.</p>
