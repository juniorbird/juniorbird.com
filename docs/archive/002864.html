				<p>For some reason I don&#8217;t fully understand, every time I go to my neighborhood McDonald&#8217;s<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002864.html#fn1">1</a></sup>, there&#8217;s some methampehtamine addict waiting in line for a vanilla cone. Is it that vanilla cones are the outside equivalent of cigarettes in the joint, a convenient medium of trade in the absence of cash? Apart from the presence of cash on the outside, that is? Are McDonald&#8217;s cones a good substitute for Tylenol, now that Tylenol is a controlled substance? Is there something special in the vanilla cone itself? If so, can just anyone get a special cone, or does one have to be visibly tweaking to get the &#8220;special dip&#8221;? Either way, I&#8217;m allergic to milk, so I&#8217;ll never find out.</p>

<p>Part of me wonders if this is just an artifact of my neighborhood. Maybe normal people taking the drive-through get cones too, but I only see the people who walk to the restaurant and go up to the counter to get cones, and the ones who go up to the counter in my &#8216;hood are all twacked out.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s great entertainment; they shuffle in place as they wait in line, then get to the front and order a cone, paying with what&#8217;s clearly one of the last few dollars they have left. Then they&#8217;ll do a little dance in a circle while they wait for the cone, adding in maybe a some quiet muttering as their hands move to their shoulders and elbows and back. But I never see them pick at their faces, either while waiting for the cone or after getting it. A tweaker waiting nicely and not picking for 5 minutes &#8212; must be a world record. Think I could patent the concept and sell it to recovery centers? &#8220;Your son has a very serious problem, Mr. and Mrs. Jaworski, but, with a residential setting, group therapy twice a day, and a vanilla cone three times an hour &#8212; chocolate-dipped on Saturdays &#8212; we&#8217;re sure he&#8217;ll be fine in a month. You should probably hide the <a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/">oxycontin</a> before he comes home. I&#8217;ll see you in two weeks for an update, you can leave your check with billing on your way out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another free business model, courtesy Juniorbird.com. Don&#8217;t thank me, I do it because I care. Now go forth and replace the twack with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans_fat">trans fat</a>!</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Yes, I know it&#8217;ll kill me faster than a crazy North Korean with nuclear weapons (<em>ed. note: soon to be determined experimentally</em>), but I only hit the MacDo, as the French call it, when I&#8217;m having a bad day. The presence or absence of bad days is, of course, not the topic of this entry. Maybe later. Or maybe I&#8217;ll write about <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002775.html"><span class="caps">CVS </span>and <span class="caps">SVN</span></a> more. We&#8217;ll see; bet you can guess.</p>
