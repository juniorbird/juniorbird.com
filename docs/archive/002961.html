				<p>So my Trojans just lost to our cross-town rival <span class="caps">UCLA</span> Bruins. And, you know what, I&#8217;m okay with that. Sure, call me a bad <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=homer&amp;r=f">homer</a><sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002961.html#fn1">1</a></sup>, but sometimes there&#8217;s such a thing as a good loss.</p>

<p>See, here&#8217;s the thing. I like to see my teams win.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002961.html#fn2">2</a></sup> And the Trojans are in a rebuilding year this year. We lost our quarterback and our running back to graduation<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002961.html#fn3">3</a></sup>, and when you&#8217;re short two Heisman Trophy winners it&#8217;s hard to be as good as you were the year before<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002961.html#fn4">4</a></sup>. And the #1-ranked Ohio State University<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002961.html#fn5">5</a></sup> is awfully good this year. Our defense is good, as shown by the first-half safety we scored, but are we up to stopping the Buckeyes? The Trojans&#8217; uneven offense can&#8217;t consistently put points on the board, and that would make any trip to the national champioinship a likely futile one.</p>

<p>Better is to go to the Rose Bowl &#8212; we won the Pac-10 &#8212; and play a great match-up against probably either Michigan or <span class="caps">LSU, </span>either of which games is eminently winnable. Then we&#8217;ll have a nice notch in our belt, look good for recruiting, and come into next year on a high note.</p>

<p>And next year will be great. John David Booty<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002961.html#fn6">6</a></sup> will only get better, the freshman backfield of Emanuel Moody and <span class="caps">C.J.</span> Gable will get better, we&#8217;re not losing major defensive players, and we&#8217;ll have a real shot at the <span class="caps">BCS </span>title.</p>

<p>Trojans coach <a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/business/leadership_tips_from_usc_football_coach_pete_carroll.php">Pete Carroll came to talk to one of my classes last semester</a>. There he spoke about the difference between challenging yourself and trying for something that&#8217;s just too much. Carroll is well-known for getting fired by the New England Patriots and the New York Jets; in the first situation, he just couldn&#8217;t handle following the legacy of famous coach Bill Parcells, who took them to the Super Bowl, and in the latter, he just didn&#8217;t win as many victories as the ownership thought he ought to<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002961.html#fn7">7</a></sup>. Coach Carroll told us that just because a challenge is the greatest challenge in the world &#8212; like coaching an <span class="caps">NFL </span>team was for him &#8212; isn&#8217;t a good reason to take it; you need to take the challenge that is right for you; taking the right challenges, and always reaching higher, prepares you to get to the biggest challenge you can face.</p>

<p>Coaching a college team is obviously the right challenge for Pete Carroll, and the Rose Bowl is the right challenge for the Trojans this year<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002961.html#fn8">8</a></sup>. It&#8217;s a good stop back on the way to the <span class="caps">BCS </span>top.</p>


<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> See definition 5.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> Damn you, Broncos!</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn3"><sup>3</sup> Best class required for graduation: ballroom dancing.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn4"><sup>4</sup> When you lose only one, then you win the national championship. But two is right out.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn5"><sup>5</sup> That&#8217;s <span class="caps">THE</span> Ohio State University to you!</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn6"><sup>6</sup> Not Mark David Chapman</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn7"><sup>7</sup> Since the next coaches went 3-13 and 1-15, instead of Carroll&#8217;s 8-8, it&#8217;s likely that he actually won more games than he ought have.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn8"><sup>8</sup> And <a href="http://dinetothrive.com">my current business idea</a> is the right challenge for me, a double, as they call it in the biz, not a swing-for-the-fences, multimillion-dollar, venture-financed home run.</p>
