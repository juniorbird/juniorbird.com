				<p>So you may have noticed that I&#8217;ve posted a lot less lately. It&#8217;s not that I have less to say; it&#8217;s that I&#8217;m doing worse at saying it. Almost 2 years ago I moved from my old stalwart Movable Type to Tumblr, with the idea that I&#8217;d spend a lot less time fiddling with my <span class="caps">CMS </span>and a lot more time writing. Well, turns out that time was well-spent, since I seemed to post a lot more when I had to do it than now.</p><p>To be honest, I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised. I&#8217;m a geek; I like these kinds of things. I can express myself creatively through writing, or I can channel that stuff into building microformats into my site. Except, not with Tumblr, which I don&#8217;t much control. (Not Tumblr&#8217;s fault &#8212; their product is very good at what it promises to be!)</p><p>So I&#8217;m back to a self-hosted system, this time on Wordpress (somehow, Movable Type seems to have given up its 6-year head start and more to be obsolete as a publishing system). Hopefully, the fooling around will inspire me to write more; not least because (obviously) there&#8217;s a lot of fidgeting to be done with this here toy.</p><p>(Speaking of fidgeting: pardon the dust here while I do my fidgeting. I&#8217;m going to do this iteratively, rather than trying to jump over in one complete, final version, so we&#8217;re going to start looking like crap and slowly, step by step, start to look better.)</p><p>Anyway, fidgeting: already fun!</p>
