							<h3>Best Renew The Library Books</h3>
							<p class="date">Mar 31, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_dreams.html">Dreams</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Waiting in line to check out my new book, I realized I&#8217;d forgotten to bring back the overdue book that I owed. Checking in my pocket, I only had a few Mexican coins &#8212; two large five-peso coins, a small three-peso coin, two tiny two-peso coins, and a medum-sized one peso coin. She&#8217;d take them.<br />

							<h3>Drink of the Month: Presbyterian</h3>
							<p class="date">Mar 23, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_drink_of_the_month.html">Drink of the Month</a></p>
						    	
							<p>As the weather turns to summer &#8212; well, at least as it does here in sunny Southern California &#8212; we may be coming to the time of year when <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003616.html">brown liquors</a> are replaced by clear ones in your everyday drinks. But, if you want something a bit refreshing, something that can stand up to a bit of spring sunlight and warm air, then let me recommend the Presbyterian. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003671.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>How to Pass Your Krav Maga Yellow Belt Test</h3>
							<p class="date">Mar 17, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_spurts.html">Spurts</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Well, I feel like I was run over by a truck or two. But, after six hours of being pounded on during a sunny Sunday afternoon, I now have my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga">Krav Maga</a> yellow belt! The <span class="caps">AIG </span>and I have been taking Krav classes since October &#8212; first once a week, and now three mornings a week &#8212; and let me say we&#8217;re hooked. It&#8217;s great exercise, great fun, and a great chance to clobber some poor unsuspecting person. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003670.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Down the Up Staircase</h3>
							<p class="date">Mar 15, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_otherwise_uncategorized.html">Otherwise Uncategorized</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Had a nice service for <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003594.html">my friend Rick</a> earlier today. Driving home, I came out of the strip mall flats of Inglewood and through the tangle of I-405 on-ramps and suddenly the sky was bright and a bank of cotton candy-fluffy white clouds sat just to my west, halfway to the ocean. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003668.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Dear City of Anaheim Signange Department</h3>
							<p class="date">Mar 14, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_dear_so-and-so.html">Dear So-And-So</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Thank you for taking me on a scenic tour of your city today, as I searched for parking for <a href="http://expowest.com">an industry conference at your convention center</a>. I never would&#8217;ve seen the reaches of Katella or Harbor avenues without the direction of the digital signs above the road, telling me where to park, what was full and what was open. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003667.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Dear Daylight Savings Time</h3>
							<p class="date">Mar 13, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_dear_so-and-so.html">Dear So-And-So</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Thank you for coming so early this year. I really appreciate how you gave me the old get-up-and-go by taking away an hour of my wasted sleep time last Sunday, and how you  bring light to the evening hours. Those energy savings would sure be nice, too. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003666.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>And This Just In: Generalissimo Francisco Franco is Still Dead</h3>
							<p class="date">Mar 12, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_dreams.html">Dreams</a></p>
						    	
							<p>We &#8212; that is, myself, the various madly-retreating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franquism">Spanish Nationalist</a> troops with which I was traveling, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franquism">Generalissimo Francisco Franco</a> &#8212; were trudging through a lightly-forested area of gently rolling and quite verdant hills. The sky was clear and the sun bright, but we didn&#8217;t expect the three Republican fighters that appeared in the distance, charging towards us. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003665.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
