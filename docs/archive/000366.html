				<p>Okay, so I haven&#8217;t blogged in quite some time. I&#8217;m a bad boy. But I&#8217;ve <a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/000365.html">been busy</a>. So here, without further ado, is the kitchen. The part of the house I love and spend lots of time in. Mmmm, I&#8217;m hungry already.</p>

<p><img src="/images/house/kitchen/kitchen.jpg" alt="looking into my kitchen, formica on floor, fridge to left, range to right, cabinets and sink ahead" />
There it is. It&#8217;s actually bigger than it seems &#8212; there&#8217;s plenty of room for two cutting boards and some veggies in the corner there.</p>

<p><img src="/images/house/kitchen/counterspace.jpg" />
Speaking of the corner, I keep a bunch of stuff there, in containers and lazy susans.</p>

<p><img src="/images/house/kitchen/sink.jpg" alt="a metal sink with a full dish-draining rack in it" />
A double sink leaves plenty of room for a drying rack. And, if anybody ever accuses me of not admitting I&#8217;m wrong, it&#8217;s disproven here &#8212; several years, a former roommate wanted one of the rotating water filters that fit on the head of the faucet. I feared such a filter would be too bulky and lobbied for one that sat on the counter and attached to the faucet via a hose; it never worked right. This little filter is a dream and cheap too.</p>

<p><img src="/images/house/kitchen/out.jpg" alt="a cart with a microwave on it, near the fridge and the sink" />
There&#8217;s room for a cart with microwave, toaster oven, Cuisinart and other equipment on it behind the fridge. Trash goes in the corner behind it. Above the cart is my spice rack, alphabetized, of course:<br />
<image src="/images/house/kitchen/spices.jpg" alt="two hanging metal racks filled with various spices"></p>

<p><img src="/images/house/kitchen/stove.jpg" alt="a range with pots on top and knives and equipment alongside" />
The oven is great, hot and accurate to within a few degrees of the selected temperature. The burners are not so wonderful; while they&#8217;re easily controllable and, thank goodness, gas at last, they&#8217;re not too hot. But what can you expect from a range that may be older than me? (Check out the hip Harvest Gold color!) Alongside is the equipment rack but the best part is the ultra-convenient knife rack below that.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s my kitchen. Be nice to me and I&#8217;ll make you dinner!</p>
