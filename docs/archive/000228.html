				<p>Who am I? I&#8217;m a 28-year-old man from Baltimore living in Los Angeles and planning to go to business school in the fall of 2004 (when, incidentally, I will be 29). I&#8217;m interested in the Web and cooking and several other topics which don&#8217;t make nearly such interesting subjects for a blog.</p>
				
				<p>Until a few months ago, I worked at a company I&#8217;d co-founded as a Web developer. Now it&#8217;s time to move along, and, for me, business school is the next thing. I&#8217;ve been working, more or less, at one remove from marketing since I graduated from college &#8212; first as a consultant at a strategic communications firm, then as a project manager at a dot-com, and, most recently, at a Web design firm I co-founded. At each stage, the core of my job involved understanding the needs of our clients, who themselves were trying to serve their clients. I&#8217;m fascinated by the idea of removing that intervening stage between myself and the consumers or stakeholders I&#8217;ve worked with; thus, I&#8217;m hoping to enter business school and pursue an education in marketing.</p>

<p>You want more details? I have a pet bird, an Umbrella Cockatoo, who is perfectly well-behaved around me but loves to terrorize others when I&#8217;m not around. I&#8217;m a voracious reader. I love to watch football. I have a black belt in Tae Kwon Do. I run an eight-minute mile (and, in fact, I once ran three consecutive 5:15 miles, but it was downhill the whole way). I know how to ride a horse. I&#8217;ve never broken any bones in my body, but I&#8217;ve broken my nose at least five times (once you&#8217;ve broken it enough, it doesn&#8217;t really count when you break it again).</p>

<p>Questions? E-mail me at the link provided on every page or, even better, post a comment and I&#8217;ll write an entry about any compelling topics of interest!</p>
