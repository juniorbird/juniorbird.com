				<p>Somehow, I&#8217;ve managed to miss everybody&#8217;s favorite new movie, <em>The Passion of the Christ</em>. I actually considered seeing it over the weekend, but, instead, I ended up seeing &#8220;Goodbye Lenin&#8221;. My brain apparently decided that I should have seen <em>The Passion</em> instead, because I had a dream I was watching the movie.</p>

<p>Actually, I think the dream was about a dream sequence in the movie, a scene which I&#8217;m sure doesn&#8217;t exist but which I, clearly, would have included in the movie.</p>

<p>In this scene, Christ is dreaming about getting crucified, or perhaps He&#8217;s imagining it. He&#8217;s first tied to the cross, then His head and arms are draped with red silk, then He&#8217;s nailed to the cross. As I watched the scene, I thought to myself, &#8220;this isn&#8217;t going to be the gory crucifixion scene, that comes when He&#8217;s really nailed to the cross.&#8221; And I was right! The nails were clearly not driven into Jesus&#8217;s hands, but instead into the cross between His arms and the red silk. As all this happens, passers-by talk about what&#8217;s going on in English.</p>

<p>Then, of course, I realized that the movie was supposed to be in Aramaic, so the language of the actors changes. Two people mock Jesus in what is probably actually German but heck I don&#8217;t speak German anyway so it might as well be Aramaic.</p>

<p>Then I woke up. This dream, I really don&#8217;t know what it means.</p>
