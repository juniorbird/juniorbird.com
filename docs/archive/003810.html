				<p>You may have noticed I haven&#8217;t posted here a lot recently. Umm, sorry. I do feel bad; I miss my old digs here! But, you see, I think there&#8217;s a lot conspiring against ol&#8217; Juniorbird.com. Part of this is changes in my life; part is changes in the Web. I have a feeling there need to be some changes around here soon, and I&#8217;d like your input.</p>

<h3>Life</h3>

<p>I went from very not busy to very busy. The not busy part was a problem; frankly, being not busy can make me feel like I don&#8217;t offer a lot of value, and so what do I have to say? And, then, being very busy means that I don&#8217;t have a lot of time to say anything.</p>

<p>Anyway, part of the problem is that I don&#8217;t have any idea what I want to talk about here. I have the feeling that&#8217;s more about too much editing and less about not having ideas; I think I need to get a little more mundane here, talking about the things I follow and my hobbies, and not trying to write really good entries. Anything you&#8217;d like to hear about?</p>

<h3>The Internet</h3>

<p>Part of the problem is that the Web is changing, and for the better. I haven&#8217;t put many links in the sidebar here because, when I share a link on Facebook or Twitter, I get responses. Interaction. Fun stuff! Just what I always wanted to get here, actually. And I get responses to the blog entries I post as notes on Facebook; interaction with my friends and stuff like that. That&#8217;s also just what I always wanted. I mean, those tools are great &#8212; they actually push out content to my friends, in a way that my friends are interested in getting that content, and then provide ways to respond! It&#8217;s like <span class="caps">RSS, </span>but with somebody on the other end!<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003810.html#fn1">1</a></sup> What vaguely megalomaniacal compulsive writer could resist?</p>

<p>But then I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d actualy use Facebook and Twitter to hold all my content, because I don&#8217;t like them keeping all my stuff, especially in the gated Facebook community. If I&#8217;m thinking of moving on now, I&#8217;m sure to be thinking of moving to the next thing in a few years again; that&#8217;s a powerful argument for holding my own content. So I really just need to figure out how to hook things up better.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003810.html#fn2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Anyway, I predict redesign in a month or two. Not bad, since I think I put up the current design about 3 years ago. Anything you&#8217;d like to see here?</p>

<h3>Umm, Twitter</h3>

<p>So, I mentioned I was Twittering up above. I know, if I&#8217;m into it, it&#8217;s probably pass&eacute;, but I&#8217;m having a tremendous amount of fun. So, until I get things fixed here and my life to the point where I&#8217;m getting to bed before 4:30am on a Thursday, please follow me at <a href="http://twitter.com/jrbird">http://twitter.com/jrbird</a>. Come on, we&#8217;ll all have some fun!</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Or, LiveJournal circa like 6 years ago. I know, I know!</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> Speaking of hooking things up better, I need to figure out how to get my Centro to talk to my Mac again, &#8216;cause that&#8217;s what&#8217;s really killing my moblog, I think &#8212; the photos are just stuck on my phone! Altho I think I will set things up so the thumbnail generation is automatic, to make things easier &#8212; recommendations on services for that will be taken!</p>

                    <p>i hear ya about the interactivity everywhere but your blog. it happens to me where i post on my blog, which feeds into FB, where i get a dozen comments on my entry, but not a single one on MT. my solution to that has just been trying to post more often so folks check in with me more often than once a month. i don&#8217;t think this is working either. </p>

<p>but back to YOU, i don&#8217;t think you need a content makeover here. i like what you post and just want to see more of it. i figure JB is your personal site where you can post on your hobbies, vacations, observations, etc. and that is precisely the peachy stuff i come here for. and not just once a month, mind you. </p>

                    <p>I know, posting frequency is part of the problem. That&#8217;s the self-censorship part; I think I don&#8217;t give my friends enough credit for what they&#8217;ll put up with me talking about. So, more of that stuff, maybe!</p>

<p>Also, I need to get better at having photo assignments for myself. That would help.</p>
