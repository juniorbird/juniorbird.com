Hello, and welcome to Cooking With Wade!</p>

<p>For those of you who like to prepare a whole week&#8217;s worth of food in advance, and have every meal ready before it&#8217;s time to eat it, well, boy are we in agreement. It&#8217;s the easiest way to eat healthy! Today, for just that purpose, we made:<br />
<img src="/images/slowfriedchicken.jpg" alt="it could be a bit charred..." />
Chicken in Garlic and Shallots. This is a great-looking dish from Alton Brown&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1584790830/">cookbook</a> that, sadly, didn&#8217;t smell as good as he promised. But it does taste pretty great! The garlic and shallots have caramelized into something that tastes like butter even though itt may be a little carburized on the outside, and the chicken is flavorful, if a bit dry (well, everyone&#8217;s oven isn&#8217;t the same). As Alton points out, it&#8217;s a fun dish because it&#8217;s easy and it uses a different and exciting way of cooking, the slow-fry. Yes, this thing is fried in olive oil in the oven over a period of an hour and a half. Odd but effortless! Although I wonder if a higher-smoke point oil, like grapeseed oil, would cook it up as good while keeping the blackening to a minimum.</p>

This is a lemony spinach and lentil dish from this great cookbook, Easy Meals One Pot, that I rescued off of the discount rack at Barnes and Noble a few weeks ago. I saw two recipes that looked fun in it so, for $4, I thought I&#8217;d take the plunge. And it&#8217;s delivered! Everything is easy and tasty, it&#8217;s a great addition. Now, this book sold so poorly that, even though it&#8217;s published by Barnes and Noble, there&#8217;s not even a link to it at bn.com. And I think I know why - every recipe has at least one wack ass ingredient in it, the kind you go, like, where the fuck am I supposed to get that? I don&#8217;t live in little Azerbaijan or Patagoniatown, I live in the middle of Los Angeles.<br />
But hey tasty is as tasty does, and I love this cookbook!</p>

<p>This weekend I had dinner with my parents. My mother planned this side dish with zucchini and mushrooms and shallots but I ended up making it - and it turned out good!<br />
So, chop up about 5 zucchinis and a pack of shiitake mushrooms.<br />
Slice two shallots in half and then slice half-rounds from them.<br />
Heat olive oil in a skillet (I used non-stick but anything would work for this)<br />
When the oil&#8217;s hot, put in the zucchini and brown them on one side.<br />
Sprinkle on salt and pepper.<br />
Flip the zucchini and add the mushrooms.<br />
Sprinkle on more salt and pepper.<br />
When the zucchini are browned on the other side, reduce the heat to medium-low and add the shallots.<br />
Sweat the shallots &#8216;til they turn transparent.<br />
In retrospect, I might add some chopped parsley at the end. But then the herb garden has a massive parsley surplus and I&#8217;m throwing it in everything these days.<br />
Anyway, all that and you end up with this:<br />

Mmmm. Eat up!</p>
