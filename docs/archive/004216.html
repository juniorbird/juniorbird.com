				<p>I&#8217;ve had this blog for twelve years, and during those twelve years it&#8217;s lived on many different platforms. It started on something home-baked, switched to Movable Type, then lived on Tumblr, and finally made its home on Wordpress. When it came time to wind things down, I knew I wanted everything in one place. This is how I made that permanent archive.</p>

<p>The first step was to define what &#8220;archive&#8221; meant. The only archive I wanted was a completely static-HTML version of the site with all the pages properly linked, plus as many images, comments, and other doo-dads as possible on the pages, where they originally were. This system had to be owned and hosted by me.</p>

<p>Keeping formatting, images, etc., goes without saying &#8212; that&#8217;s part of preserving what I created. Owned and hosted by me should also be obvious; while Blogspot seems like it will last forever, you never know. Having it on my own system prevents surprises. (Of course, I need to make sure I have a real backup somewhere.)</p>

<p>But why the static HTML? Well, that&#8217;s a security thing. All content management systems will eventually be hacked, even a blogging system. The more outdated it is, the more vulnerable. The worst thing, security-wise, to do would be to throw up a system; get it running; and then forget about it. In the future, that&#8217;s sure to be hacked, and all content to be lost.</p>

<p>On the other hand, static HTML pages are essentially unhackable.</p>

<p>What could import everything and also export static HTML, while running on my own servers? Well, Wordpress can do everything except for static. <a href="http://www.movabletype.com/">Movable Type</a>, on the other hand, publishes static pages by default, and a whole MT site works without involving the CMS at all, from a visitor&#8217;s point of view. </p>

<p>A nice side effect of going for MT was that I could use my old templates. So, say hello to the format I used during the golden age of Juniorbird.com!</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the step-by-step to getting your own permanent archive of your old blog:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get a cheap webhost. I like <a href="http://dreamhost.com">Dreamhost</a></li>
<li><a href="http://movabletype.org/downloads/stable/">Download Movable Type</a>. I like the 4.3.8 version but feel free to try one of the 5.x versions if you haven&#8217;t used it before.</li>
<li><a href="http://movabletype.org/documentation/installation/">Install Movable Type</a></li>
<li>Import all content into your Wordpress blog. You can import Tumblr content into a wordpress.com blog easily or <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/tumblr-importer/">use the plugin</a> if you&#8217;re self-hosted.</li>
<li>Export everything from Wordpress</li>
<li>If you&#8217;ve been using formatting plugins, such as Markdown, in Wordpress, <a href="http://plugins.movabletype.org/">find them for Movable Type</a></li>
<li><a href="http://movabletype.org/documentation/administrator/maintenance/import-export.html">Import into Movable Type as Wordpress XRSS</a></li>
<li>Everything&#8217;s there! You can clean up detail formatting or not</li>
</ol>

<p>Enjoy your blog archive!</p>
