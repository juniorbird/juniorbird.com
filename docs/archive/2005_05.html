							<h3>PRIME: Chile vs. Brazil Deathmatch</h3>
							<p class="date">May 31, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a>, <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_travel.html">Travel</a></p>
						    	
							<p>We got to see two countries. Both were pretty cool! But which should I go back to (or, maybe, go back to first)? Let&#8217;s figure this out for once and for all with this one-on-one deathmatch between these two South American countries. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001520.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>You, sir, while ultimately conveying me successfully from the airport to my home, did not uphold the standards held up by taxi-drivers around the world. Taxis may be a method&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001516.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>PRIME Brazil: Fort Copacabana</h3>
							<p class="date">May 27, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a>, <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_travel.html">Travel</a></p>
						    	
							<p>So there was this flu-like thing that was making its way slowly through the whole <span class="caps">PRIME </span>group; I got it two weeks ago. Fortunately it only lasted a day and a half (as compared to up to a week for other people), but, as soon as I felt better, I went out for <em>churrascaria</em> and several caipirhinas, and that was pushing it too hard; the flu turned into a stomach thing that laid me up for most of another day. So, today I took it easy, walking down Copacabana beach to the beautiful Fort Copacabana. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001513.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>PRIME Brazil: The Sights of Rio</h3>

							<p>Vacation at last. After a week of <span class="caps">PRIME </span>activities, a day of travel, and, admittedly, a day by myself in S&atilde;o Paulo, it&#8217;s finally time to really get free and have fun! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001511.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>PRIME Brazil: Samba!</h3>

							<p>With fortune on our side, some members of my little group in Rio made friends with some locals, and said locals invited us out for dinner and dancing at a Samba club. And I have discovered why Brazillians are so skinny: Samba! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001510.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>PRIME Brazil: S&atilde;o Paulo -- Chicken Hearts, Being "That Guy", Pinacoteca, and Leaving S&atilde;o Paulo</h3>

							<p>I&#8217;ve been a bad blogger! But I&#8217;ve been a busy traveler. So here&#8217;s the update for the last three days of S&atilde;o Paulo, including one day of <span class="caps">PRIME </span>class; one day of walking around the city; and, of course, travelling to Rio de Janeiro, from whence I am posting. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001509.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>&#8220;I have no questions. I have nothing to add.&#8221; That&#8217;s what you want to hear from the <span class="caps">CEO </span>of a major cable TV company after you&#8217;ve presented to him, and that&#8217;s what my <span class="caps">PRIME </span>consulting team got from the president of Brazillian cable leader <span class="caps">NET</span> Servi&ccedil;os. Two days in Brazil, four fun and interesting site visits, some good food, and a funny tour guide &#8212; plus that positive response &#8212; how can you do better? <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001508.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Santiago PRIME, Day 3</h3>
							<p class="date">May 16, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a>, <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_travel.html">Travel</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Today I made a mistake. We went to the Vinos Concha y Toro vineyard, and I thought we&#8217;d be there just for meetings and speeches; instead, we got a tour of the whole complex. And me not with my camera! So there will be no photos of Concha y Toro. Nor will there be &#8212; and I doubt you&#8217;ll be unhappy about this &#8212; any photos of the teams presenting to Bice Bank or Banco Santander Santiago. (Yes, we are here to give real actual consulting presentations!) <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001507.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Santiago PRIME, Day 2</h3>
							<p class="date">May 15, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a>, <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_travel.html">Travel</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Santiago is very European town; it could pass for a French or Spanish city, with parts of historical beauty and parts of awful &#8217;80s architecture and parts of deteriorating &#8217;50s concrete buildings. The people are also very European, with only, apparently, the road workers and cooks showing much Indian ethnic background. This makes for a very different feel than most of Latin America &#8212; especially Mexico, to which I&#8217;m somewhat used &#8212; and it means that Santiago mostly lacks the &#8220;exotic&#8221; women I typically go for. Also, it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m all that, but I&#8217;m kind of used to the Mexican women checking me out. In fact, I&#8217;ve been hit on even in front of the Wonderful Girlfriend. Maybe it&#8217;s the camera around my neck, or the little memo pad in which I take notes, or the not-in-style clothes, but the women in Santiago won&#8217;t even make eye contact. Apart from that, this town is a ton of fun. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001506.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Welcome to day #1 of my <a href="http://www.marshall.usc.edu/web/Prime.cfm?doc_id=3217"><span class="caps">PRIME </span>trip</a>. It&#8217;s 8:30pm and it&#8217;s almost time for dinner in Santiago, Chile. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001503.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>The Other Key to Finals Success: Stop Sassing Back!</h3>
							<p class="date">May  5, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I have this attitude problem: if I don&#8217;t agree with what The Man is saying, I&#8217;ll express my opposition through homework and test-taking. That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;ll rebel by expressing my opinions in soundly-formulated, grammatical, written arguments. Watch out, I&#8217;m a wild man. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001487.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Coming out of our Globl Strategy final on Monday, and then our Management of Organizations final today, my poor classmates were cradling their wrists and complaining of all of the pages and pages of answers they had to write out. But not me. No, I trained long and hard for tests just like this through two solid years of High School AP History. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001483.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>At first, I thought that the all-hours late-&#8217;70s arena rock and hair metal was, well, eccentric but amusing. I mean, who really ever gets enough Boston? And a little Styx, now and then, is okay. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001475.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
