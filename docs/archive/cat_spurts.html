							<h3>Fear of a Speed Blue Planet</h3>
							<p class="date">Feb  7, 2010 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_spurts.html">Spurts</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Shortly after I met my wife, we went over to her friends’ place to watch the Super Bowl. Now, she’s known these people for years — the guy since her&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/004018.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Ground & Pound & Wound Up</h3>
							<p class="date">Mar 26, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_spurts.html">Spurts</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Usually, 2 hours at <a href="http://www.kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> gets me nice and calm. (Granted, I don&#8217;t usually need help being calm. But bear with me here.) An hour of self-defense plus an hour of cardio/weights/bag work will take the edge off&#8230; But last night I left class raring for some excitement. &#8216;Cause last class I was reminded of how much I like ground work. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003813.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>These Krav Students Walk Into a MMA Fight...</h3>
							<p class="date">Feb  8, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_spurts.html">Spurts</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Call me bloodthirsty. Some years ago &#8212; back in junior high and high school &#8212; I took Tae Kwon Do, and sparred regularly. It was a way of driving off the introvert shyness, and learning action and control. When I started taking <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=krav+maga">Krav Maga</a>; and, for that matter, when I see the <span class="caps">UFC </span>or something on TV &#8212; that makes me miss fighting. When the <a href="http://kravmaga.com/">Krav studio I go to</a> announced that, henceforth, graduates of the Fight class would fight in front of an audience, well, I sure wanted to be part of that audience, as did the <span class="caps">AIG.</span> So, towards Santa Monica with us! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003798.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Well, I feel like I was run over by a truck or two. But, after six hours of being pounded on during a sunny Sunday afternoon, I now have my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_Maga">Krav Maga</a> yellow belt! The <span class="caps">AIG </span>and I have been taking Krav classes since October &#8212; first once a week, and now three mornings a week &#8212; and let me say we&#8217;re hooked. It&#8217;s great exercise, great fun, and a great chance to clobber some poor unsuspecting person. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003670.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>It&#8217;s fall, and that means that long weeks stretch from Monday evening to Saturday morning. No, it&#8217;s not work, it&#8217;s football, and there are four long days without it every week during the winter. With early evenings, darkness, and the cool autumn air, that leaves a profound longing. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003503.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I suppose it&#8217;s no secret that I haven&#8217;t followed the Orioles closely in years. And it&#8217;s no secret why &#8212; they don&#8217;t make it to Anaheim often, and Chavez Ravine even less; they&#8217;re almost never on TV over here; and, of course too many losses, too little in the way of positive changes. But the O&#8217;s<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003421.html#fn1">1</a></sup> are my team, and I love them. I love them even though they lost their last game 30-3, becoming the first team to give up 30 runs in 110 years. Actually, I think I love them even more now.<br />

							<h3>At Least Eli Still Sucks</h3>

							<p>Darn. Well, the Colts won. Evil has triumphed in the world, not least because good appears to have been incompetent. What else is new? Thanks to the magic of gin and barbecue, I was able to make it through all three-and-some hours of depressing football, interspersed with remarkably mediocre ads<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003112.html#fn1">1</a></sup>. It&#8217;ll be ok. Actually, the whole Super Bowl experience kind of showed me where I need to set my expectations and plans in life. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003112.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Well, today&#8217;s the big day. We have the <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003087.html">forces of evil</a> against the forces of&#8230; Chicago. We all know what side I come down on! I&#8217;ll be rooting hard the whole game, and I believe that Da Bears! can win. I do! They&#8217;ve got the tough defense, and Manning crumbled against Baltimore&#8217;s D. They&#8217;ve also got the tough running attack, with a good up-the-middle runner and a competent edge runner too, which Baltimore didn&#8217;t have. It&#8217;ll be a tough game, but the Bears will win in the end. We all need to get on the bandwagon and root for good over evil, and I know just the thing to get you there: <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003108.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>College football season&#8217;s on its way, which means, naturally, that the sports pages are full of stories of <span class="caps">NCAA </span>violations. Some, such as Oklahoma quarterback <a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/NewsStory.asp?ID=060803_Ne_A1_TwoSo69334">Rhett Bomar&#8217;s accepting money for a job he didn&#8217;t do</a> are relatively serious. Others, such as <span class="caps">USC </span>reciever <a href="http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-usc10aug10,0,3529500.story?coll=la-home-sports">Dale Jarrett&#8217;s roommate&#8217;s father paying for a luxury apartment</a> are simply a sign that the existing system, which effectively prohibits most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_I">Division I</a> scholar-athletes from holding any useful job, is badly broken and needs to be fixed. Specifically, it needs to be possible for Division I schools to pay their athletes for playing sports. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002717.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>2006 NFL Draft Recap</h3>

							<p>As everyone knows, the <span class="caps">NFL </span>draft is step 1 on the path to the really important football event of the year, the fantasy draft. Oh, and said draft makes a big difference as I watch my beloved Broncos and Ravens all season long. Will they win? Lose?

							<p>Like many Americans, I suffer from repetitive stress injuries, and it is only because of these that I&#8217;m not today a professional football coach or, with my stature, safety. However, also like many Americans, I certainly know as much about football as any coach or safety (although perhaps not as much as an offensive lineman), and therefore I plan to hold forth on exactly whom I pick to win tomorrow&#8217;s big game. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002248.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>The beauty of blogging is that, over a period of years, a dedicated writer can develop an audience of up to several, gain the trust of this audience, and thus have a stage upon which to stand when he shouts out that one absolutely, completely, and preposterously crazy truth that only he knows. Now is that time for me. Now is my time to say, I feel bad for Terrell Owens, I know where he&#8217;s coming from, I understand why he&#8217;s holding out and I&#8217;m <em>down with it</em>. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001678.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
