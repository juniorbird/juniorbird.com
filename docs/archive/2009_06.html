							<h3>The One-Man Tivo</h3>

							<p>Have you noticed how many shows Gordon Ramsay has these days? For weeks at a time it seems like we watch nothing but his shows: Kitchen Nightmares, Kitchen Nightmares <span class="caps">UK,</span> Hell&#8217;s Kitchen, you know the story. The thing is: they&#8217;re all good. Gordon Ramsay makes for good TV! And now he&#8217;s got a new show (well, new in the US): <a href="http://www.bbcamerica.com/content/159/index.jsp">The F Word</a>, and I seem to be watching that one every night too. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003829.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Won't Somebody Please Think of the Hangers-On?</h3>

							<p>I have this vision that Michael Jackson has spent the last few years surrounded by people who had no interest other than diverting as much of his money as possible towards their own support. Despite all the schadenfreude I felt over the King of Pop&#8217;s many scandals, I also always felt sorry for him, robbed as he was of any pretense towards a normal life at any time. All of which is a little weird since he wasn&#8217;t just King of Pop, he was King of the Whole World while I was in Elementary School. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003828.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>So this <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003821.html">wedding thing</a> has been pretty much a full-time job. Ceremony, reception, <span class="caps">DJ, </span>flowers, dress, tux &#8212; the list goes on and on. There&#8217;s so much to get done, we haven&#8217;t even gotten to pick where we&#8217;re going for our honeymoon. Fortunately, we got one important thing done: we&#8217;ve set up our registry. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003827.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I got home from a recent week-long trip to find no cable. Worse, it had gone out just after I left, so I got home from a recent week-long trip to find a Tivo full of nothing but &#8220;Just a Moment, this Channel Will Be Available Shortly.&#8221; Time Warner took two whole days to come out and fix it. I could almost hear the babies crying, such was this tragedy. My poor, empty Tivo! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003825.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
