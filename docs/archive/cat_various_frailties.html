							<h3>Malingering</h3>

							<p>If I were wheezing and gasping for breath as I begged for an appointment with my doctor&#8217;s receptionist, would you want me to keep it down during said begging? <span class="caps">OK, </span>you&#8217;d probably want to hear all the drama of my life since you were stuck waiting for your appointment. Being a gossip hound, I know that was exactly how I felt. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003417.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>So, this weekend was my 10-year college reunion. I was all pumped to go, despite a very long and exhausting week, so that I could show everyone what a big success I am. But then, in my role as a LA Fire Department Rescue Jumper, while bungee-jumping from a helicopter in order to rescue a kitten from onrushing floodwaters, I threw out my back. So, instead, I&#8217;ve spent the weekend in my most orthopedically-correct chair. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003267.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Worst. <s>Episode</s> Shoulder. Ever.</h3>

							<p>In our <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003015.html">last episode</a>, it was revealed that our hero had a very very sore shoulder. Well, insofar as it&#8217;s the holidays, and I&#8217;m with my family, and they&#8217;re footing the bill, and we&#8217;re staying at a hotel with an attached spa, I thought I&#8217;d get a massage. Because, as we learned in Thailand, <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002680.html">massages fix things</a>. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003020.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Those of you who have been following along for quite a while may remember The Incident With The Roll-Out Bed. For many years, when visiting my Grandma<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003015.html#fn1">1</a></sup> for christmas, I slept on this fold-up bed on wheels that got rolled out only when I was in town. When I was six, this contraption, whose purchase only slightly antedated my father&#8217;s birth, was quite adequate. However, when I turned 14 or so, one night on this bed left me writhing on the floor in the way that only a sore back can make one writhe. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003015.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Are you thinking of a <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/001587.html">summer internship in or temporary relocation to Arizona</a>? Think twice, it’s dangerous. Interns and others who choose to temporarily relocate to Arizona, or any of the other Western desert states may find themselves catching Valley Fever. I think I did! Your temporary relocation to, or internship in, Arizona could feature the substantial downsiede of weeks of coughs, fatigue, and worse. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001606.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I&#8217;m officially cured; praise be, my legs are whole again! Well, not that whole. I&#8217;m supposed to start out by running a quarter mile, then increase that slowly.

							<p>Up until recently, I was getting physical therapy for shin splints and for plantar fasciitis. The treatments went well, the shin splints are almost gone and the pain from the&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000031.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>When I was but a wee bairn, I loved to read books because of the colors on the pages. Not the pictures, but the words. Different words had different pastel&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000033.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
