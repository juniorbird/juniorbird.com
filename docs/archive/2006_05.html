							<h3>I Hereby Propose</h3>

							<p>That all us lefties henceforth refer to Republicans as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Franco">Franquistas</a>. You know, as in, &#8220;those Franquistas in the <span class="caps">GOP,</span>&#8221; or  &#8220;my Franquist opponent.&#8221; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002648.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Junior's Man-Crush</h3>
							<p class="date">May 28, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_junior.html">Junior</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Junior has a new best friend, a new person whom he seems to love more than all others. When I <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002623.php">had to leave town</a> recently, Rick &#8212; who used to own parrots &#8212; took care of Junior. Ever since, Junior has been madly in love. Junior sits in his cage staring out the window, waiting for Rick to walk past, to his bike or garage; then, when Rick&#8217;s out there, Junior starts talking sweetly and then yelling &#8220;hello!&#8221; to his new friend outside the window. Yes, Junior&#8217;s head over heels. Fortunately, Rick seems to like him back. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002640.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>VersaMail Sucks (and How to Uninstall it)</h3>
							<p class="date">May 27, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_tech.html">Tech</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Like many people who got a Treo, I was at least somewhat excited that I could sync my e-mail with Outlook using the built-in VersaMail program. While I&#8217;m far too cheap to pay for the unlimited data transmission plan that would allow me to send and receive mail over the cell network, I definitely wanted to sync mail I wanted to keep around for reference with my Treo. Unfortunately, VersaMail failed miserably, sucked completely, and, virus-like, was virturally impossible to uninstall.<br />

							<h3>Incipient Dissatisfaction</h3>
							<p class="date">May 26, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_otherwise_uncategorized.html">Otherwise Uncategorized</a></p>
						    	
							<p>For the past two years, I&#8217;ve jealously guarded my weekends &#8212; guarded them from, you know, people and other similar time sucks that expect my interactive attention. And it was great. One, maybe two nights a week I&#8217;d have enough free time that I could spend it on me. You know, watch Cops, read a book, ogle attractive women, things like that, and never a second wheel to distract me from my entirely non-interactive me time.<br />

							<p>I like taking photos. In fact, I like taking photos enough that I&#8217;m going to try to make it a part of my life &#8212; I&#8217;m going to go out shooting regularly. Hopefully this will result in me getting, you know, actually good at it. In the interim, you&#8217;ll get to see me traverse that space between &#8220;you admit to taking that?&#8221; and &#8220;hmm, might use that as my desktop background!&#8221; My first shot was with my friend <a href="http://vmac.smugmug.com/">Vance</a> in the scenic and verdant LA River. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002630.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>The ex-WG&#8217;s grandfather had a medical crisis last week; fortunately he&#8217;s doing well now, but he&#8217;s been in the hospital for a bit and is still recovering. I went down to San Diego to visit her family and provide support. It was a tough time for everyone involved but it was also good to be around people I care about and like. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002623.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>So did I mention that I graduated on Friday? I&#8217;m officially an <span class="caps">MBA.</span> I think the description for what I&#8217;m feeling now is &#8220;bittersweet, elated terror.&#8221; I definitely feel as if I&#8217;ve accomplished something incredible, but, gosh, the pressure to now accomplish something even more incredible is that much greater. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002600.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I&#8217;ll admit it, I&#8217;m getting a little sick of writing a recap every week. I might not choose to continue this in the future.

							<h3>Junior!</h3>

							<p>I was going to go shooting with a friend this week, but I&#8217;ve been swamped by administrativa. Still, between that plan and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harlykwin714/133078791/">Amy&#8217;s new hardware</a>, I had to get some practice in. Specifically, I had to better understand the exposure and color performance of <a href="http://amazon.com/o/ASIN/B000A7JKTA/wadearmstrong-20/ref=nosim/">my camera</a>. For a project like that, I needed a subject that had bright whites as well as dark details. Hmm, it occurred to me, I have one of those sitting next to me! So, without further ado, here&#8217;s my best buddy, Junior Bird. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002588.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I turned in my last paper at about 12:30 pm today; I think that means I&#8217;m done. I&#8217;m completely in shock, I don&#8217;t believe that I really won&#8217;t be going&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002586.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>I'm A Bad Man</h3>
							<p class="date">May  7, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_otherwise_uncategorized.html">Otherwise Uncategorized</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Last night I was out with some friends; we ended up at a divey sports bar in Santa Monica. To put it briefly, it sucked, and we wanted to go across the street to a cooler bar, but one of my friends had just gotten herself a nice cool bottle of Corona. Since she was too much of a pussy to chug the beer, she stuck her beer in my chest pocket and started to prod me to smuggle her beer into the new bar. Then my other friend joined in, and how could I resist two women daring me to do a bad bad thing? So I closed my jacket over the beer and we walked across the street. I played it cool and we slipped right past the doorman and into the dance floor in the back, where I slipped out my friend&#8217;s beer and she nursed it for another 20 minutes. I&#8217;m a bad man. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002580.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<h3>Men Wearing The Wrong Collars Make Me Sad</h3>
							<p class="date">May  3, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_sightings.html">Sightings</a></p>
						    	
							<p>It seems that gentlemen these days are fond of the tie-with-button-down-collar look, which, I suppose, is a wonderful idea if you really like your collar to poof out, exposing the parts of the tie that wrap around your neck inside the collar. Me, I prefer to restrict the visible parts of my tie to a reasonably competent knot and the wide end, hanging down to the middle of my belt. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002567.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>So That's What a Quarter of a Million People Looks Like!</h3>
							<p class="date">May  1, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_photos.html">Photos</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Being now a man of leisure, I took most of the day off to head downtown and take some photographs of the protest for immigrants&#8217; rights. Coincident with an immigrant boycott of all business around the country, marches like these were designed to bring the current absurd lack of meaningful policy conversation, much less reform, into the spotlight. We&#8217;ll be lucky if they succeed. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002562.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>2006 NFL Draft Recap</h3>
							<p class="date">May  1, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_spurts.html">Spurts</a></p>
						    	
							<p>As everyone knows, the <span class="caps">NFL </span>draft is step 1 on the path to the really important football event of the year, the fantasy draft. Oh, and said draft makes a big difference as I watch my beloved Broncos and Ravens all season long. Will they win? Lose? And how will this year&#8217;s crop of Trojans perform? <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002560.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
