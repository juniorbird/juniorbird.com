							<h3>Smackdown: The Blind Side vs. Precious</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov 24, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_reviews.html">Reviews</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I saw a double feature over the weekend: <em>The Blind Side</em> and <em>Precious</em>. Yes, it was a depressing double feature. Yes, I cried. Actually, I cried a lot more for <em>The Blind Side</em>; <em>Precious</em> just left me exhausted. And, while the whole wanting-to-go-to-bed-at-3:30pm-on-a-Sunday thing was a bit of a downside for the whole plan, I would definitely recommend seeing the two in a row; they just have some kind of an affinity for each other. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003852.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>How to Get Your WiFi Network to Cover Your Whole House</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov 19, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_tech.html">Tech</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I live in a <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003702.html">cool house</a>. It&#8217;s not large, except apparently by the standards of WiFi networking. For an urban elitist liberal like me, being separated from my Gmail or <a href="http://thisisphotobomb.com/">Photobomb</a><sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003851.html#fn1">1</a></sup> for as much as a few hours would be&#8230; disastrous. Plus, I work out of the garage, so I have to get e-mail<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003851.html#fn2">2</a></sup> there. Thus, my quest: cover the property with WiFi. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003851.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Beholden to The International Printing Conspiracy</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov 18, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_tech.html">Tech</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I have this dream, a very, very hopeless dream. My dream is that someday I will be able to print greeting cards on my very own color printer, featuring the photos that I took my own self. <span class="caps">OK, </span>so I have small dreams. The point is, I&#8217;d pay to live this particular dream. And that worked for parasailing, so I don&#8217;t know why greeting cards would be more difficult.  <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003850.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Government Web Sites Considered Dangerous</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov 11, 2009 in </p>
						    	
							<p>Like any good geek, I&#8217;d rather do things online then, you know, have to call or go to an office and interact with an actual human being. Thanks to Amazon Prime, I barely have to buy any technology or home products in a store anymore. In this household, we&#8217;ve tried to do some of our governmental-interaction things online as well. And it&#8217;s been a complete, unmitigated disaster. I can say with confidence that I will never, ever, do any government-related activity online again. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003849.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>The Only Problem With Not Having a Land Line is Knowing What Number to Give at the Grocery</h3>

							<p>Now that I live in a blended household, I find myself using our phone number at checkout counters to save the few percent that some loyalty program gives. In the old days, this would&#8217;ve been an easy job: type our happy home&#8217;s phone number into that swipe-your-credit-card-and-sign pad and we&#8217;re done. But, like the modern kids we are, we&#8217;re cell phone-only and our happy is phone number-free. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003848.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I may be predisposed to a bit of <a href="http://www.aetv.com/hoarders/">hoarding</a>. Not that I collect empty yogurt containers or save used tissues; I just often find myself inclined to keep, you know, bowls that people gave me twelve years ago, or maybe I forget to throw away the stub of the movie ticket for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242445/">Exit Wounds</a>.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003847.html#fn1">1</a></sup> One time, Mrs. DJ L&#8217;il Bit said this thing that helps me out, whenever I&#8217;m struggling to decide to throw something away or not: &#8220;that decorative peeler is not your mother&#8217;s love.&#8221; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003847.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>How to Assign a Drive Letter to an Airport Disk on Windows XP</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov  2, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_tech.html">Tech</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I&#8217;ve been using a Time Capsule to back up my Mac for some time now, and have been very satisfied. I was wishing that I could run some kind of over-the-air backup for my wife&#8217;s laptop, which runs Windows <span class="caps">XP, </span>too. So I attached a <span class="caps">USB </span>hard drive to the Time Capsule, and tried to mount that on the Windows XP laptop. First I did it the wrong way, and there was much sadness. Then I did it the right way, and life was easy. I couldn&#8217;t find a description of how to do it right in a quick Google search, so here&#8217;s my story. It&#8217;s probably true for an Airport Extreme Base Station too, since that and the Time Capsule are similar.<br />

							<h3>Pavlov's Resort</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov  1, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_travel.html">Travel</a></p>
						    	
							<p>The hardest part of coming home isn&#8217;t the end of the adventure, or the not being alone together, or driving on the right side of the road; it&#8217;s the lack of drums. At <a href="http://lalati-fiji.com">Lalati</a>, drums tell you about everything. Happy hour? The drums will call you. Dinner? Drums! Time to go on the group snorkeling trip? You guessed it, drums. I keep on forgetting to have lunch because there&#8217;s no drums to tell me it&#8217;s lunch time, and I spend all afternoon looking forward to the 5pm happy hour drums, yet they don&#8217;t come. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003845.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
