							<h3>Me, Meet Box</h3>
							<p class="date">Jan 31, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a></p>
						    	
							<p>If you&#8217;re interested in classifying yourself &#8212; and goodness knows, I classify everything so such an exercise certainly appeals to me &#8212; a good place to start might be the <a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes1.htm">Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</a>, a scientifically un-validated test that classifies everyone into one of 16 groups with four-letter names. I&#8217;m an <span class="caps">INTJ</span>; every time I&#8217;ve taken the <span class="caps">MBTI </span>&#8212; whether a fake version online I found in college or the real, authorized one I took in b-school or the several in between &#8212; I&#8217;ve come out an <span class="caps">INTJ.</span> But I took this other test for a class, the <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/j/5/j5j/IPIP/"><span class="caps">IPIP</span>-NEO</a>, and, well, the overlap between the two makes it clear that I&#8217;m in that little box formerly labeled <a href="http://www.biercephile.com/">Misanthrope</a>. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002235.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
							
							<h3>(Re)Introducing WadeArmstrong.com</h3>
							<p class="date">Jan 29, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_elsewhere.html">Elsewhere</a></p>
							
							<p>Those of you who have been around for a while may remember that I used to have a blog over at WadeArmstrong.com, which I used as a part of my b-school application. Well, I&#8217;ve threatened for about a year that I&#8217;d bring back my eponymous site as a more-professional face to me; now I&#8217;ve gone and done it.</p>

<p>WadeArmstrong.com is intended as a marketing tool for myself, a networking tool, and a place where I can collaborate on projects with my&#8230; um&#8230; collaborators. It&#8217;s got a blog and a wiki and a contact form and a downloadable resume and that&#8217;s about it, but I think it&#8217;s moderately clever and maybe even a little fun to look at. At least it&#8217;s the same color as one of my favorite shirts. I&#8217;m planning to blog there about business, entrepreneurship, technology, productivity, and, well, me.</p>

<p>So check out <a href="http://wadearmstrong.com">WadeArmstrong.com</a>, and check out my latest entry, analyzing <a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/business/disneypixar_why.php">why Disney may have bought Pixar</a>. It was like the pulling of the teeth, oy, writing a fairly-long, professional-stylee article like that, but, with practice, I know it&#8217;ll get easier and my writing will even get something approaching coherent. Tell me what you think! And, if you&#8217;re interested in these topics, what you&#8217;d like to see me write about in the future; I plan to write one of these quotes professional unquotes things a week.</p><a href="Those of you who have been around for a while may remember that I used to have a blog over at WadeArmstrong.com, which I used as a part of my b-school application.

							<h3>99 Days</h3>

							<p>In 99 days, I&#8217;ll actually be an <span class="caps">MBA.</span> Seems far off; seems like I&#8217;ve been in school forever. Being in the real world will be a bit of a shock!&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002222.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Well, That's Some Democracy We Got Us Over There In The Middle East (Or, Why I'm Actually Happy Hamas Won)</h3>
							<p class="date">Jan 26, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_ye_olde_politicks.html">Ye Olde Politicks</a></p>
						    	
							<p>It&#8217;s a good thing that Hamas <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/01/26/palestinian.election.1604/index.html">won the latest Palestinian Authority election</a>. I&#8217;m all for it. I&#8217;m a Jew, and sympathetic to old-fashioned Zionism, but, most of all, I&#8217;m an American and, by birthright, I believe in democracy and opportunity for everyone, and this is the best way to give democracy to the Palestinians and opportunity and, even, security, to the Israelis. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002219.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>How To Disrupt Business School</h3>

							<p>I&#8217;m sitting in the courtyard of the business school right now, and an enormous smell of marijuana just descended over the place.

							<h3>Oh Yeah, I Went To Costa Rica Over The Holidays</h3>
							<p class="date">Jan 20, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_travel.html">Travel</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I landed in Costa Rica on Christmas Day. One of my <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001004.php">2005 New Year&#8217;s Resolutions</a> was to travel more, and part of that turned into a holiday trip down South, with friends from Marshall. After hours of flight over water, we wheeled over mountains rising directly from the beach and swooped low over small farming fields and jungle. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002207.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I guess I can put that aside. I was all worried we&#8217;d get to see a third consecutive year of the Colts physically and morally dominating the Broncos; instead, the&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002191.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>How To Show Entries From Multiple Blogs on Your Archive Pages in Movable Type</h3>
							<p class="date">Jan 15, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_meta.html">Meta</a></p>
						    	
							<p>If you check out the \monthly and category archives below, you&#8217;ll notice that the formerly separate moblog, linkblog, and diary parts of this site share the same archive pages. A lot of blogs out there have just this kind of content, but store it completely seperately; if you&#8217;d like to have posts from your moblog, linkblog, and blog or diary, all on the same archive page, and are using Movable Type, you can do it by following the instructions below. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001816.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Serious Worries</h3>

							<p>I&#8217;m a Broncos fan from way back, so you&#8217;d think I&#8217;d be excited that they beat the Patriots in the playoffs today. No dice. It was a painful game to&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002184.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<h3>New Year's Resolutions</h3>

							<p>There&#8217;s nothing better than belated resolutions! Well, technically there was an extensive discussion of resolutions on New Year&#8217;s Eve, but I chose not to rush from dinner directly to an Internet cafe to share them with you. Not that I don&#8217;t love you, just that I was far more focused on getting loaded. But, in a tradition reaching back <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000353.php">two</a> <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001004.php">years</a>, here are my resolutions for 2006. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002166.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Things That Seem Weird Now That I'm Back Home From Costa Rica</h3>

							<p>Sure, it&#8217;s nice to be home, but one side effect of leaving the country is a smidge of culture shock when you return. I mean, I just got home and am finding the following quite odd: <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002160.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
