				<p>It seems, on the one hand, a little absurd that two people who just had a baby would be thinking about giving that baby to someone else to care for. Nanny, daycare &#8212; oughtn&#8217;t the parents be best for the baby? On the other hand, I prefer to hire someone with experience to do my plumbing, auto repair, database administration, and other skilled jobs; why not someone who&#8217;s worked with babies before? &#8216;</p><p>Yeah, we&#8217;ve been doing the finding-childcare thing lately. I love <a href="http://www.edd.ca.gov/disability/Paid_Family_Leave.htm">paid family leave</a>, but at some point the wife and I will get off what I&#8217;m pretty sure conservatives call Welfare and get back to work, so we need to find some options for Declan.</p><p>We&#8217;ve looked at the nanny thing, and we&#8217;ve looked at local daycares. Naturally, having already had our baby, it&#8217;s far, far too late for us to look for daycare at the most prestigious places, like the place we visited on Wednesday with the two-and-a-half-year wait list. I felt a little silly looking at their infant rooms&#8230; but not as silly as the nice couples with two-year-olds on the tour must&#8217;ve felt. Enjoy your month in daycare before first grade, kids!</p><p>I&#8217;ll admit, I&#8217;m a little confused about how any infants get into a program with a two-and-a-half-year-long wait list that requires a confirmed pregnancy to get on it. But we&#8217;ll move past that for a moment. Beyond the waiting list, was there anything I took away from my daycare tours? Yes, in fact, there was:</p><ul><li>It&#8217;s important to have children in your daycare when you offer tours; no matter how cutting-edge your prestigious daycare is, it looks cold and, frankly, silly without kids in it.</li><li>Your tour should be given by someone who can sell, or a teacher who obviously has the personality to connect with kids, not by a cold, efficient administrator, no matter how skilled that administrator is.</li><li>If you have a good daycare, you have a long waiting list; almost nobody with a good daycare is trying to grow to absorb more of their waiting list. A kingdom of riches probably awaits someone who can figure out how to scale the provision of daycare services.</li></ul><p>So I think we&#8217;ve chosen which daycare to apply to. Which is great, because I&#8217;m excited about the place. It reminds me of the caregivers who showed me love when I was growing up, and if Declan does half as well he&#8217;ll have a wonderful start to life.</p>
