				<p>In the end, I got into one top-20 school, waitlisted at two others, and shot down by a fourth and a top-five school. Not a bad outcome, especially given that I did the whole thing at the last minute. Would I do it all the same again? Mostly.</p>
				
				<p>I do feel I came pretty close to maximizing my outcome, given how late I started and my somewhat non-standard resume. Were there any things I could have done differently?</p>


<ul>
<li>I don&#8217;t think this blog helped. I tried to stay more-or-less professional and on-message, and I think it resulted in a more boring blog. </li>
<li>I was too on-message in my interviews. What can I say, I do it for a living? Especially at <span class="caps">NYU,</span> I felt that the interviewer concluded that I wasn&#8217;t being  forthcoming because everything I said matched up with what he&#8217;d read. I just considered this being clear.</li>
</ul>



<p>Ideally, anybody applying to b-school will start no later than June of the year before they hope to start attending school. Had I made the decision to get my <span class="caps">MBA </span>that early, I could have:</p>


<ul>
<li>Gone to various <span class="caps">MBA </span>fairs, meeting admissions staff. Starting a new job and studying for my <span class="caps">GMAT,</span> I just couldn&#8217;t afford to give up an entire afternoon and evening. But maybe, as it turned out, I couldn&#8217;t afford to stay in.</li>
<li>Participated in all those online forums. That probably would&#8217;ve helped me perform better in the details.</li>
</ul>



<p>One thing I don&#8217;t regret is really going for it on my essays. I pushed the envelope and I wrote pieces that reflected me. They weren&#8217;t as stolid as many, I&#8217;m sure, but I do believe that they showed both a strong facility with the language and an ability to write in simple, bullet-pointed, businesslike sentences.</p>

<p>All in all, it was a pretty successful little project. I can&#8217;t wait for the fall!</p>
