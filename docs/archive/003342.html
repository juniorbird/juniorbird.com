				<p>I fear I&#8217;m about to make a great many enemies; but it can&#8217;t be avoided. Sometimes, one has strong opinions, and it&#8217;s at those times that one must stand up and state one&#8217;s beliefs, damn the consequences. This is one of those times. And this is my belief: A Martini is not a gin drink, or a vodka drink: it&#8217;s a vermouth drink.</p>

<p>I know there are those who would disagree with me &#8212; you might call them &#8220;everyone involved, in any way, with popular culture over the last twenty years&#8221; &#8212; but, once you&#8217;ve tried a few, you&#8217;ll agree with me. The cult of the extremely dry martini (&#8220;pass the closed vermouth bottle quickly over the shaker&#8221;) just doesn&#8217;t deliver the flavor. I mean, really, what&#8217;s so exciting about slowly sipping four shots of straight gin or vodka?<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003342.html#fn1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>For years, I took my Martinis very, very dirty. And dirty Martinis are a great thing, because, let&#8217;s face it, olives are absolutely brilliant. But I&#8217;ve realized that the reason I gravitated so quickly to the dirty Martini was that the trendy dry Martini had essentially no flavor, especially the super-trendy dry vodka martini. I still love the dirty Martini.</p>

<p>But lately I&#8217;ve discovered how to make a perfect Martini. No, that&#8217;s not a boast: I actually make a perfect Martini.</p>

<p><img src="/images/martini/perfectalone.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>A perfect Martini includes both sweet and dry vermouth. You can make one too! The original ratio of vermouth to gin<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003342.html#fn2">2</a></sup> for a martini was 1-to-3, which advanced to 1-to-4 or 1-to-5 during the &#8217;50s and &#8217;60s, before somehow becoming 0-to-whatever more recently. Try out various ratios and see what you prefer; the Martini in my shot used a 1-to-4 ratio, and the 1/8 part of sweet vermouth gives it the golden color. The perfect gin Martini is a delicious drink, with hints of juniper (of course), vanilla, and even butter. If you prefer a vodka Martini, and are prepared to spend on top shelf, I recommend Chopin vodka, for an exceptionally smooth drink with heavy vanilla and a hint of a botanical.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003342.html#fn3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Now, until just this week, I would&#8217;ve recommended Tanqueray<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003342.html#fn4">4</a></sup> as the right gin for a Martini, and I&#8217;m still a big fan in the dirty Martini, but, based on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/02/dining/02wine.html?ex=1182398400&amp;en=d049cb3576cd1185&amp;ei=5070">New York Times&#8217;s taste test</a>,  I thought I&#8217;d try the highly-rated and extremely-cheap Seagram&#8217;s. Well, I guess those awful Bronfmans made their money doing something useful enough, because Seagram&#8217;s is an awfully darned good gin. It&#8217;s got tons of flavors, but nothing bitter or dissonant, just some nicely-melded botanicals that have some bite without even the hint of gasoline. I&#8217;d say this gin is my new favorite.</p>

<p>A Seagram&#8217;s perfect Martini. Try it!<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003342.html#fn5">5</a></sup></p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> The answer of my Russian and Polish grandparents would probably be &#8220;what&#8217;s <em>not</em> exciting about sipping four shots of straight vodka?&#8221; But this is one case in which I must turn away from my ancestors and strike out in new directions.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> The original Martini was a gin drink; the vodka martini is a recent innovation.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn3"><sup>3</sup> If your budget&#8217;s smaller, Smirnoff is a great vodka choice.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn4"><sup>4</sup> Not the more expensive, trendier, and easier-to-find Tanqueray 10, which comes in a lovely bottle and is quite nice but has too much lemon and too little juniper flavor for me.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn5"><sup>5</sup> Now where&#8217;s my check, Edgar?</p>
