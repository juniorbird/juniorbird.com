				<p>There&#8217;s nothing better than belated resolutions! Well, technically there was an extensive discussion of resolutions on New Year&#8217;s Eve, but I chose not to rush from dinner directly to an Internet cafe to share them with you. Not that I don&#8217;t love you, just that I was far more focused on getting loaded. But, in a tradition reaching back <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000353.php">two</a> <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001004.php">years</a>, here are my resolutions for 2006.</p>

<h3>Last Year’s Resolutions Reviewed</h3>


<ol>
<li>Set aside specific, scheduled time, several days a week, to exercise. Let’s be more specific than last year, and so hopefully accomplish more.<br />
<em>Did well at this for half a year, then my feet gave out. No more running for me!</em></li>
<li>Get, and stay, on a diet that helps me eat right. One hard thing about school is how often I grab what I can and in what quantities I can. I will get and stay on a diet that works with reality but helps me make the right decisions.<br />
<i>Did well for most of the year but then <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002051.php">used butter for evil</a></i></li>
<li>Take a Spanish class.<br />
<em>Actually, my Spanish is better than I expected; I just need to speak it more!</em></li>
<li>Update my wiki more often. It’s a tool for me, a place where I can write down stuff I need to keep track of. I need to regularly use it as such. Maybe a daily “wiki time”?<br />
<em>Done!</em></li>
<li>Call my grandmother more often.<br />
<em>Done!</em></li>
<li>Keep better track of my finances. My existing system, which had worked well for several years, just didn’t survive contact with the enemy — b-school is too time-intensive to spend three-quarters of day a month keeping everything up-to-date. I need a better system.<br />
<em>Good for the first half of the year, then Quicken blew up on me. I give up on Quicken. I&#8217;ll figure out a solution when I&#8217;m out of b-school</em></li>
<li>Use my Sur La Table card for cooking classes. I can do this during the school year if I pick the right days!<br />
<i><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002113.php">Spent it on something else</a></i></li>
<li>Set up a monthly drinks or dinner group with my friends. Especially my school friends need to not talk about class all the time.<br />
<em>Too much of a nerd for this!</em></li>
<li>Set up a monthly or bi-weekly poker game with my friends. I’ve been in this poker game put on by some friends at school but the time is basically impossible for me. I need to start my own at a good time for me.<br />
<em>Too much of a nerd for this!</em></li>
<li>Doveryay, no proverya.<br />
<em>Done!</em></li>
<li>Network. I probably need to set aside time each week to do networking things.<br />
<em>I&#8217;m apparently pretty good at this, although it&#8217;s always good to redouble one&#8217;s efforts on a topic like this.</em></li>
</ol>



<h3>This Year&#8217;s Resolutions</h3>

<p>This year I have fewer resolutions but hope to keep more of them. We shall see&#8230;</p>


<ol>
<li>Travel travel travel</li>
<li>Learn a new language (or actually make my Portuguese useful)</li>
<li>Start swimming</li>
<li>Start a second, tightly-focused, well-edited blog to complement this amorphous, occasionally well-written, occasionally abysmally-written site</li>
<li>Lose 7 lbs</li>
<li>Try to find a new martial arts studio, so I can get back into that hobby</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a></li>
<li>Do something with the restaurant club, or some other collective eating project</li>
<li>Network!</li>
</ol>



<p>Not a bad list. I hope, in 12 months, we can see most or all of these checked off the ol&#8217; list. Any good reoslutions out there? Anything you think I need to resolve to do?</p>
