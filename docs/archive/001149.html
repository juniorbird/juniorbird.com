				<p>I love <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/001043.html">my group</a> this semester, but they&#8217;re very different from <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/000675.html">last semester&#8217;s group</a>. In The Ocho, leadership was a sort of rotating affair &#8212; everybody was inclined to take leadership, at least some of the time, and if I didn&#8217;t want to be in charge I&#8217;d just wait and someone else would take the reins. But Group A-6 is different. There&#8217;s some evidence that I might actually be <a href="http://www.rinfret.com/ah.html">in charge here</a>.</p>


<p>Which is definitely not to say that there aren&#8217;t five other potential leaders in my group. I&#8217;ve seen several other group members take leadership roles in the past, and everyone&#8217;s aggressive and on top of things. But, for some reason, people look to me. They run ideas past me, they ask me what to do &#8212; the financial guys even bother to explain things to me rather than just working around the gaps in my knowledge and understanding. Camraderie? Sure.</p>

<p>But it also has something to do with my leadership habits. One of my specific traits is to &#8220;keep things going&#8221; &#8212; I keep track of time, of goals, make sure we keep on target. I&#8217;m aggressive about this, I speak up about it. And now it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m speaking up about everything. And everyone&#8217;s listening to me!</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s bad for me. Not because I don&#8217;t like being in charge, because oh boy I do (and I&#8217;d hope that I wouldn&#8217;t be in b-school if I didn&#8217;t); it&#8217;s bad because I like to lead by consensus. I like to have buy-in from those I lead for any decision. This is a situation with a lot of buy-in, and that just encourages this trait in me.</p>

<p>Buy-in is good, but it&#8217;s not always possible. There will always be hold-outs, and, as a leader, sometimes you need to tell those people what to do. I&#8217;m not good at telling people what to do. Just my luck, I&#8217;d get a leadership opportunity in a positive situation that doesn&#8217;t tax me.</p>
