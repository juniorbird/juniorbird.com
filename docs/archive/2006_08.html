							<p>I know I haven&#8217;t updated in a while; I&#8217;ll be back in a bit with a new host and a new look for this blog. Hope to see you back&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002737.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Warning: Source of this Blog May Burst Into Flames</h3>
							<p class="date">Aug 15, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_tech.html">Tech</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I write this blog on a two-year-old Dell Latitude <span class="caps">D600 </span>laptop, a laptop which, I am now informed <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/07/28/another-dell-laptop-ignites/">may</a> <a href="http://community.tomshardware.com/dellpost.html?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=192887&amp;ex=Dude-Dell-freaking-blew">vent</a> <a href="http://kd7lrj.blogspot.com/2006/07/dell-laptop-battery-trouble-at-novell.html">with</a> <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=32550">flames</a> &#8212; or, if you&#8217;re not a technology marketer, the battery can explode and catch on fire. Given my <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000646.php">previous level of satisfaction with Dell products</a>, you can believe that I&#8217;m super-excited and happy about this development. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002727.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>A Brief Commentary on the Apple Stock Option Trouble</h3>
							<p class="date">Aug 12, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_bidness.html">Bidness</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I&#8217;ve had a couple of friends IM me today asking me &#8220;what&#8217;s going on with the whole <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1155027932371">Apple stock option <span class="caps">SEC </span>trouble thing</a>?&#8221; Now, I know nothing more about this than the average business school student with a few classes on options and on financial reporting, but I guess that&#8217;s a few more than average so I&#8217;ll expound a bit on what appears to be going on, and if it&#8217;s serious or not. Everything below should be taken with a small grain of salt, at least, since there have been no public, comprehensive statements on what&#8217;s going on by either Apple or the <span class="caps">SEC, </span>but the stories in the press appear to be quite consistent and clear in what they&#8217;re describing. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002722.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Clearly I'm Insensitive to Issues of International Politics and Security</h3>

							<p>While hearing about the latest round of foiled terrorists and new flight security restrictions, all I&#8217;ve been able to think is &#8220;thank goodness I didn&#8217;t have to fly across the Pacific without my iPod, water, and hand lotion!&#8221; I realize this makes me a complete boor. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002720.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Just Go Ahead and Pay the Freakin Football Players!</h3>

							<p>College football season&#8217;s on its way, which means, naturally, that the sports pages are full of stories of <span class="caps">NCAA </span>violations. Some, such as Oklahoma quarterback <a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/NewsStory.asp?ID=060803_Ne_A1_TwoSo69334">Rhett Bomar&#8217;s accepting money for a job he didn&#8217;t do</a> are relatively serious. Others, such as <span class="caps">USC </span>reciever <a href="http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-usc10aug10,0,3529500.story?coll=la-home-sports">Dale Jarrett&#8217;s roommate&#8217;s father paying for a luxury apartment</a> are simply a sign that the existing system, which effectively prohibits most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_I">Division I</a> scholar-athletes from holding any useful job, is badly broken and needs to be fixed. Specifically, it needs to be possible for Division I schools to pay their athletes for playing sports. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002717.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Best of Southeast Asia</h3>

							<p>If you&#8217;re like the friends I instant message with &#8212; and who isn&#8217;t, these days &#8212; then you took one look at my <a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/200720">Southeast Asia vacation photos</a> and said &#8220;hey, there are more than 400 photos here! Aren&#8217;t any of them good?&#8221; The answer, of course, is &#8220;sorry, no!&#8221; But, despite that unfortunate fact, I&#8217;ve collected this &#8220;best of&#8221; list so that you can pretend to have looked at my photos, and compliment me on them, while not actually having to wade (heh) through them! And away we go! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002715.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
