				<p>It&#8217;s tax season, and I&#8217;m as interested in how much the government is taking out of my pocket as the next guy. So I was intrigued to learn of a new <a href="http://www.sbecouncil.org/businesstaxindex2009/">small business-focused ranking of state tax burdens</a> from <a href="http://twitter.com/WSJSmallBiz"><em>Wall Street Journal</em> Small Business reporter Kelly Spors</a>. Now, I&#8217;ve started two businesses in famously high-tax California, and I&#8217;ve never found taxes to be a big enough problem that any of my time was justified in thinking about them rather than running the other parts of the business. But I know that a lot of businesses that have been around longer and are in more of a sustaining than a growth mode have real concerns about tax burdens, so I was looking forward to reading and learning from this report. Unfortunately, the ranking is comically sloppy.</p>
