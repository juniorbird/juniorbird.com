				<p>So TiVo recently announced that <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/la-et-tivo17nov17,1,7409270.story">they&#8217;re going to run banner ads when you fast forward through ads</a>. The <a href="http://www.pvrblog.com/pvr/2004/11/tivo_to_add_ban.html">blogosphere</a> <a href="http://www.brianbehrend.com/archives/2004/11/tivo_to_add_ban.php">went</a> <a href="http://battellemedia.com/archives/001050.php">wild</a>, not least becase of the LA Times&#8217; inflammatory headline, &#8220;TiVo Will No Longer Skip Past Advertisers&#8221;.</p>

<p>TiVo is all about the next generation of TV watching, so it&#8217;s natural that, during the product&#8217;s evolution, there will be changes, and these changes will make some people uncomfortable. But this seems like an authencally good idea, with little downside for either viewers or advertisers.</p>

<p>All <span class="caps">PVR</span>s (or <span class="caps">DVR</span>s), including TiVo, make advertisers scared, for two reasons:</p>


<ul>
<li><span class="caps">PVR</span>s let users fast-forward through ads, thereby ignoring marketing prodtimeucts that cost millions of dollars to produce and place</li>
<li>PVrs let users watch TV shows at unexpected times (&#8220;-shifting&#8221;), which can mess with demographic predictions</li>
</ul>



<p>Viewers love <span class="caps">PVR</span>s, because:</p>


<ul>
<li><span class="caps">PVR</span>s let viewers fast-forward through ads</li>
<li><span class="caps">PVR</span>s let viewers watch shows when they want to watch shows</li>
</ul>



<p>Clearly, we have two stakeholders whose interests are in complete opposition, right? Maybe not, if we think about what these stakeholders actually want, when it comes to ads.</p>


<ul>
<li>Advertisers want viewers to attend to, and retain, their ads</li>
<li>Viewers want their desired content to be interrupted as little as possible while they watch TV</li>
</ul>



<p>That second one is very important. It&#8217;s not about ads, per se, for viewers; it&#8217;s simply that viewers, quite naturally, want to see their show uninterrupted. Who actually likes interruptions? Users don&#8217;t fast-forward because they hate ads, users fast-forward because they hate being taken away from their desired content. Most of these fast-forwarding users happily watched 30-minute ads for products like GI Joe, The Transformers, He-Man, <a href="http://www.captainpower.com/">Captain Power</a>, and other products like that; in those cases, the ads were the content, and nobody complained or tried to skip them simply because they were being sold to.</p>

<p>The fast-forward banner ad does a good job of fulfilling both advertisers&#8217; and viewers&#8217; needs. Viewers get minimal interruption. Advertisers get an ad that will be closely-attended as the user focuses on fast-forwarding only through the ads and not through the show. This is a great solution for a new way of advertising.</p>
