				<p>I don&#8217;t really have an entry here; I just schlepped my camera along with me as I enjoyed my fourth of July, and I thought I&#8217;d share it with you all. Now, some might say that I should&#8217;ve schlepped a tripod, too, what with the night pictures of fireworks and all, but those people would be spending waaay too much time thinking ahead and waaay too little time getting out of the house. <span class="caps">OK, </span>normally that&#8217;s me, but for once I thought I&#8217;d just go for it.</p>

<p>So first we met the <span class="caps">AIG&#8217;</span>s roommate&#8217;s friends at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Hahn_State_Recreation_Area">Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area</a>, which I&#8217;d never been to. For a park about 10 minutes away from my apartment, it&#8217;s super-large and pretty cool. Also, there&#8217;s oil derricks everywhere. I&#8217;m definitely headed back!</p>

<p>Then it was off to Veterans Memorial Park to see the fireworks. We went to the park &#8216;cause that way we didn&#8217;t have to pay $5 to see the fireworks at the school. Oh well, we weren&#8217;t the only cheapskates. First we sat around while a bunch of folks set off fireworks in the middle of the park:</p>

<p>That was all fun and games until one of the mortars turned over on its side and started to launch fireworks towards the crowd. A bunch of teenagers ran away at a high rate of speed. But the school put on a great show; I just wish I&#8217;d been able to get the smiley-face fireworks in a good shot. They even had lots of cool multicolor explosions that I hadn&#8217;t seen before (granted, <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002696.html">I was in Saigon</a> for the 4th of July last year).</p>

<p>Did you know that there were 2.5 million people in the 13 Colonies at independence? There&#8217;s about 300 million Americans now. Cool!</p>
