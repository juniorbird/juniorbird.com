				<p>My wife, the lovely DJ L&#8217;il Bit, was standing next to me in the kitchen one day, and telling me about one of her friends: &#8220;she likes to measure out everything, she&#8217;s a thorough person, you know the type, she&#8217;s a measuring Jew.&#8221; All this as I was pouring my breakfast cereal into a one-cup measure so that I could, you know, have the calories advertised on the side of the box. Little did I know that there was a whole class of people like me.</p><p>It&#8217;s not that I deny my label. You might even describe me, and the Jewish people I know, as either &#8220;rather messy&#8221; or &#8220;excessively specific.&#8221; I think of myself as tending towards the former but that might just be a little bit of that old self-doubt creeping through. There&#8217;s some evidence. Like, the measuring of the cereal. Like, the measuring of everything else.</p><p>Getting an iPhone just made it worse: now I have a tool to track everything I do, at my side all the time. It&#8217;s like giving <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wweek.com/editorial/3209/7105/">miniature roses</a> to the <a target="_blank" href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002864.html">residents of my old neighborhood</a>. I track the normal stuff, like my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus_for_iphone/">tasks</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.billingsapp.com/iphone/">time</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.marketcircle.com/daylitetouch/index.html">all my clients</a>. I&#8217;m tracking my <a target="_blank" href="http://milebug.com/">mileage</a> &#8212; hey, it&#8217;s a good tax write-off! I track my <a target="_blank" href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/track-your-weight/id300436590?mt=8">weight</a>. Since I want to lose that fat on my midsection, I track my <a target="_blank" href="http://wodapp.com/">workouts</a> too. I <a target="_blank" href="http://www.clickpodproductions.com/site/Track_%26_Share.html">track</a> if I take my vitamins and if I fix my own lunch or eat out and things like that. It&#8217;s all very&#8230; existentially rewarding. Who doesn&#8217;t want to quantify their own performance and enjoyment?</p>
