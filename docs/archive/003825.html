				<p>I got home from a recent week-long trip to find no cable. Worse, it had gone out just after I left, so I got home from a recent week-long trip to find a Tivo full of nothing but &#8220;Just a Moment, this Channel Will Be Available Shortly.&#8221; Time Warner took two whole days to come out and fix it. I could almost hear the babies crying, such was this tragedy. My poor, empty Tivo!</p>

<p>So, strapped for things to watch, I turned to <a href="http://hulu.com">Hulu</a> and <a href="http://netflix.com">Netflix</a>. It&#8217;s not the first time; I think I&#8217;d seen an episode or two of The Office on these services, and thought it was pretty cool. But there are limits to what I want to watch on my computer screen. Or, so I thought. Turns out not to be so true. The tiny little Hulu pop-up window &#8212; maybe twice the area of a YouTube video &#8212; fits perfectly in the corner of my screen, making it easy to revisit old <em>Babylon 5</em> episodes.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003825.html#fn1">1</a></sup> Netflix doesn&#8217;t have that handy little feature, but it has helped me get into <em>Heroes</em>, all while I do other things. Well, pretend to do other things. </p>

<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s been great, except there&#8217;s no <span class="caps">UFC </span>content on Hulu. Hint, hint, Dana White. I&#8217;ll have a few seasons of some good shows under my belt in no time.</p>

<p>As for the cable <span class="caps">TV, </span>the nice man from Time Warner came by and plugged it back in. Former IT manager that I am, I never checked to see if the coax was actually hooked up to the cable box. I think that means I&#8217;m executive material. Either way, I&#8217;ve hardly even looked at Tivo since.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> I never claimed to have good taste. Actually, it&#8217;s great, I barely saw <em>Babylon 5</em> when it was on <span class="caps">TV, </span>because it was all on somebody else&#8217;s schedule. Tivo freed me from those schedules, and Hulu does the same.</p>
