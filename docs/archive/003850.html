				<p>I have this dream, a very, very hopeless dream. My dream is that someday I will be able to print greeting cards on my very own color printer, featuring the photos that I took my own self. <span class="caps">OK, </span>so I have small dreams. The point is, I&#8217;d pay to live this particular dream. And that worked for parasailing, so I don&#8217;t know why greeting cards would be more difficult. </p>

<p><a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/Honeymoon/Queenstown/9973654_HcVev/1/#692089127_EFeXD-A-LB"><img src="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/Honeymoon/Queenstown/DSCN0003/692089127_EFeXD-M.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>One option is to just buy a bunch of nicely-printed cards. The photo host I use, <a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com">Smugmug,</a>, offers some real nice ones, but I have to buy a bunch, and most of the time I just need one, for a birthday card or whatever, and then I want to try to pick just the perfect picture for that card. So I make my own. Now, I have Photoshop and Illustrator and InDesign and, worst of all, I actually know how to use all of them. I even have the occasional clever thought,<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003850.html#fn1">1</a></sup> so I might could come up with a card design. But it takes much longer to put a nice card together than I would really like to spend on it, so I usually end up bored of the process and come up with something kind of half-assy.</p>

<p>What I&#8217;d really like is a simple program with a couple of dozen designs that I can just drop my photos into, then print something out on my color printer. Easy, right? Except I&#8217;ve tried a good half dozen greeting card-printing programs and have found the following problems to exist pretty much all at once in every single one:</p>


<ul>
<li>Doesn&#8217;t actually print anything but full-page</li>
<li>Card designs worse than your average free MySpace page theme circa 2006</li>
<li>Can&#8217;t rotate, crop, or otherwise fit your pictures</li>
<li>Can&#8217;t add text</li>
<li>Card designs only allow you to use one photo, or seven photos, or some fixed number, but there&#8217;s always only one fixed number in the whole program and you&#8217;re just stuck with it, pity if you didn&#8217;t want five photos on your card</li>
<li>All help and manual text in <a href="http://engrishfunny.com/">Engrish</a><br />
 <br />
I can&#8217;t imagine this would be a difficult program to make, compared to some that are out there, and the upsell possibility of additional card designs is massive. Won&#8217;t somebody please take my money? </li>
</ul>



<p>Until then, I&#8217;m stuck paying a vendor a chunk of money for a bunch of cards when I really only need one. There&#8217;s only one reason why this should be: somebody&#8217;s paying the indie developers off. Must be them all are getting a cut of the big online print-on-demand greeting card industry. They&#8217;re around every corner, those printers.</p>

                    <p>I had decent success making a card just by creating something in Word, and printing it on some cardstock.  I did the printing at my local copy shop (Copy America! [1]), both b/c I had to be there anyways to <i>buy</i> cardstock, and because they had a big straight-through printer, whereas mine would wrapped it around rollers a couple times, which I figured probably would not be good for it).</p>

<p>[1] Note that the exclamation point on the end is an important part of the name. They are <i>very excited</i> about both copying, and America, and especially about copying America.</p>

                    <p>Clearly, everything about that worked except nothing was changed in size.</p>

<p>I love Movable Type, except for the fact that the whole commenting part of the megillah uses entirely different tags than the rest of the content-generating end of the software. So, I don&#8217;t know how to troubleshoot this.</p>
