				<p>You may have noticed the changes made to this site: the ads and the (return of the) links box on the right. Nothing like blowing a little vacation on the blog!</p>

<p>The links box is back for a good reason: the Web is all about the links. I had a links box in the original version of this site, but had a hard time keeping it up-to-date and, besides, it was just a box of links to links. Now, it&#8217;s a spiffy scrolling box of links. And, yes, I read all of those sites regularly &#8212; at least once a week.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s only one catch to the links box &#8212; it&#8217;s only compatible with Firefox, IE 6+, and, probably,  Safari and the latest versions of Opera. If you&#8217;re using one of the latter two browsers, please tell me of the links box is horribly broken. If you&#8217;re not using one of the abovementioned browsers, well, you should be. That includes you, Mac IE users. I used to be one of you, but now I use <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/central.html">a browser that doesn&#8217;t suck</a>. Coding for your browsers makes my life harder and limits the fun features that I can inlclude.</p>

<p>The ads were a harder choice. I want to make this a site full of, at least, moderately-engaging content. Ads can take away from that. Fortunately, Google&#8217;s AdSense program offers ads that are, at least theoretically, matched to the content on the page. Hopefully the ads will be relatively relevant and interesting; I know I&#8217;ve seen a few that have caught my eye.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the ads are here to make me money. As of the time of this writing, I&#8217;ve made $0.05. That averages out to&#8230; $1.50/month. That won&#8217;t quite pay for hosting but it&#8217;s actually not too far off what I&#8217;m paying. If I could make $2-$7/month, that would be great. $10 would be a small miracle. Seems achievable.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s the changes. More coming someday, including:</p>


<ul>
<li>Spiffy month-at-a-glance archive pages, bringing together moblog, blog, and longer entries, to make things more fun for the browser.</li>
<li>Spiffy category-at-a-glance archive pages, bringing together blog and longer entries, to make things more efficient for the information-seeker.</li>
<li>A pretty new look!</li>
</ul>



<p>All when b-school gives me time. So, around August, then.</p>

<p>In the meantime, readers, I&#8217;d love to hear what you think! All three of you.</p>
