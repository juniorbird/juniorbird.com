				<p>The hardest part of coming home isn&#8217;t the end of the adventure, or the not being alone together, or driving on the right side of the road; it&#8217;s the lack of drums. At <a href="http://lalati-fiji.com">Lalati</a>, drums tell you about everything. Happy hour? The drums will call you. Dinner? Drums! Time to go on the group snorkeling trip? You guessed it, drums. I keep on forgetting to have lunch because there&#8217;s no drums to tell me it&#8217;s lunch time, and I spend all afternoon looking forward to the 5pm happy hour drums, yet they don&#8217;t come.</p>

<p><a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/Honeymoon/Fiji/10099048_8HVmp/1/#718727310_ycJc6-A-LB"><img src="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/Honeymoon/Fiji/IMG9940/718727310_ycJc6-M.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>In the abstract, the whole being-called-by-a-drum thing sounds a little&#8230; controlled. Who wants to be dictated to on their vacation? But, trust me, nothing says vacation to the modern executive/freelancer-type more than the concept that you don&#8217;t have to be responsible for anything. That&#8217;s what the drums are about: you&#8217;re on an island with tons of people who have no job other than to take good care of you. </p>

<p>Especially after a long vacation, with tons of &#8220;drive there&#8221; and &#8220;show up here on time to start that activity&#8221; and &#8220;pick what&#8217;s for dinner&#8221; and &#8220;how much money do you want to change,&#8221; giving up a little responsibility is a good thing. Heck, I&#8217;m a gourmet cook and some days I just can&#8217;t handle the responsibility of fixing any kind of dinner at all &#8212; and not because I don&#8217;t have time. And I miss the good care that Dick would take of me!</p>

<p><a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/Honeymoon/Fiji/10099048_8HVmp/1/#718745126_u9LLX-A-LB"><img src="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/Honeymoon/Fiji/IMG0065/718745126_u9LLX-M.jpg" /></a></p>

<p>Overall, it&#8217;s a little embarrassing to admit this. Usually I&#8217;m the guy who goes to all of the authentic restaurants and stays outside of the big tourist areas and tries to learn a little bit of the local language. Not with Fiji. With Fiji I wanted to be pampered, and so they drummed me what to do at what time of the day.</p>

<p>So this morning I woke up and sat on the couch in my robe for quite a while, because there was no drum to remind me that I should do something. Lunch has come late every day since we got back to the States because there&#8217;s been no drum to remind me it&#8217;s time to eat. I&#8217;m a well-trained pup. </p>
