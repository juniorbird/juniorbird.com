				<p>If you&#8217;re a football fan like me, eagerly awaiting the arrival on TV of those sweet, sweet games you&#8217;ve been waiting for all year (and, even better, the start of your Fantasy Football game), then you may know that we&#8217;re now in football training camp season. As an intellectually pompous youngster, I used to go to nerd camp &#8212; right down the street from the Redskins&#8217; training camp.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jhu.edu/~gifted/">Nerd camp</a> took place at <a href="http://dickinson.edu/">Dickinson College</a> in bucolic Carlisle, <span class="caps">PA.</span> Every day was filled with classes, and, after classes, there were all sorts of activities available; some of these were even athletic. Now, I know you&#8217;d hardly expect nerds to want to play sports, but it was actually quite relieving to:</p>


<ol>
<li>Play sports with individuals who were, um, at my skill level</li>
<li>Learn that there actually were athletes who were smart, they weren&#8217;t all evil and socially oppressive</li>
</ol>



<p>So, most afternoons, my friends and I would head over to some of Dickinson&#8217;s practice fields to play Ultimate Frisbee. And, along the way back, we&#8217;d walk past Dickinson&#8217;s football field. There would always be twenty or thirty Redskins players and coaches on the field, warming up for their second two-a-day. We&#8217;d often stick around for a few minutes and watch, but we were all nerds and didn&#8217;t really get what was going on. Plus, I was from Baltimore, and the Redskins were our mortal enemies.</p>

<p>For three years, I got to see the Redskins at training camp; then, a couple of years later, I actually learned to like football. If I could go back, I&#8217;d ask nerd camp to teach a class in &#8220;Appreciating Football&#8221;. Nerd camp, and the &#8216;Skins, are still in Dickinson, and, dammit, school nerds need to learn to be sports nerds too!</p>

                    <p>And here I always thought the point of football was to provide a yearly platform for interesting advertisements. <strong>g</strong></p>

<p>Do Ultimate Frisbee players really count as &#8220;athletes&#8221; in the &#8220;high school jock&#8221; sense?  It seems to be the sport of choice of nerds and hackers.  There was a Friday afternoon UF game among the M$ interns, when I was there, and we played UF fairly often at <a href="http://www.acadiainstitute.com/" rel="nofollow">AIO</a>, the CTY-recommended camp I attended for several summers.</p>
