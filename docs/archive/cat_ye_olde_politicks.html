							<p>So I grew up in a part of the country where national politics was everyday news. All the Senators and Cabinet members and whatnot were just down the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore-Washington_Parkway">B-W Parkway</a> and their foibles were as likely to make the Maryland section of the paper as the National. And I absorbed it all &#8212; I had opinions on all the Secretaries, every Senator, the fitness of the overall Congressional delegation from each state, to say nothing of policy issues. But I didn&#8217;t watch Obama tonight. Sadly, I just don&#8217;t care.</p>

							<p>Election season is nigh; candidates are dropping right and left. Central to this year&#8217;s campaign is Iraq. How soon do we get out? <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20070701faessay86401/barack-obama/renewing-american-leadership.html">Obama</a> and <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20071101faessay86601/hillary-rodham-clinton/security-and-opportunity-for-the-twenty-first-century.html">Clinton</a> say &#8220;real soon now&#8221;,<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003654.html#fn1">1</a></sup> while <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20071101faessay86602/john-mccain/an-enduring-peace-built-on-freedom.html">McCain</a> suggests we&#8217;re in it for the long haul and <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20080101faessay87112/michael-d-huckabee/america-s-priorities-in-the-war-on-terror.html">Huckabee</a> punts, saying he&#8217;ll stay in there as long as the military wants but not a second longer.  The two parties offer an interesting and inadvertent dichotomy, because no party puts the needs of the Iraqis first.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003654.html#fn2">2</a></sup> This results in a campaign in which the Republicans want to sacrifice American lives to save Iraqis, and Democrats want to let Iraqis die to save Americans. To say this is an unexpected reversal of roles is an understatement. And, although I&#8217;m deeply uncomfortable with the concept, I do support a policy that has Iraqis dying so Americans don&#8217;t. In fact, I think we should get on with the Iraqis dying as soon as possible.<br />

							<p>Well, now Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are running for President in &#8216;08. That means that us lefties can say goodbye to the White House for probably the next 12-16 years.

It&#8217;s a funny entry, written in the form af a primer on the concept of planning, because I once thought that all we needed was a good plan and we could win the war in Iraq, the war on terror. It was really funny, but sometimes the times we live in are not funny. Sometimes the times we live in are fucking hopeless.

							<p>One thing about me &#8212; a detail which makes me substantially less useful as a person from whom you can borrow a book &#8212; is that, like many geeky boys, I enjoy my military history books. My tastes in this genre tend strongly to more-technical works which completely describe the challenges individuals and states face and then give a complete history of how that challenge was surmounted (or not). Right now I&#8217;m reading a particularly interesting (to me), if perhaps somewhat detailed and dry, book, <a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691015953/ref=nosim/wadearmstrong-20">The Arming of Europe and the Making of the First World War</a>. I&#8217;ve recently come to a chapter that describes the oft-forgotten Bosnian crisis of 1908, a historical event that, at the time, appeared to be a complete victory for Germany and Austria-Hungary but which turned out to be, unexpectedly, a complete disaster for those two Powers. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002769.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>While hearing about the latest round of foiled terrorists and new flight security restrictions, all I&#8217;ve been able to think is &#8220;thank goodness I didn&#8217;t have to fly across the Pacific without my iPod, water, and hand lotion!&#8221; I realize this makes me a complete boor. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002720.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Let's Outsource Fear!</h3>

							<p>Well, we finally got Zarqawi, which clearly means that we only have one problem left &#8212; Iran and its nukes. Lots of people suggest that we should engage the Iranians in productive dialog, resolving security issues jointly and building a better world. Others say that only pussies engage others and resolve things jointly. Of course, it&#8217;s the latter group that&#8217;s in power, which is why I feel the need to put forth the following solution, one which is simultaneously macho and engaged. We spend too much of our time worrying about whether or not some crackpot terrorist is going to nuke us; I hereby propose that we outsource our worrying to the Iranians. If they&#8217;re spending all their time worrying about whether or not the US gets nuked, they&#8217;re unlikely to provide fissile material to people who want to nuke us. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002661.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Watching the talking heads on <span class="caps">TV, </span>it seems like everyone&#8217;s spouting off about keeping the borders secure, about not rewarding immigrants who have come to the US illegally, and about how much it costs to finance illegal immigrants here in the <span class="caps">US.</span> Well, I&#8217;ve got bad news for you all, but those are exactly the wrong questions to be asking here.

							<p>Apparently, we&#8217;re all supposed to get our panties (or, I guess, in my case, boxer briefs) in a twist because a bunch of our ports are going to be run by people from Dubai. Apparently, said people from Dubai will, with malice aforethought, leave our ports open to terrorist attack. There is no specific rationale &#8212; apart from a general and vague divergence of overall goals &#8212; presented for why destroying our port infrastructure will be the goal of these same ports&#8217; new managers, but this viewpoint is certainly widely accepted as reasonable. But it&#8217;s not reasonable; it&#8217;s racist. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002323.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>The case of Terry Schiavo, currently <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/03/21/schiavo/index.html">playing itself out in the Federal courts</a>, is a sad one. I can understand the positions of both Terry&#8217;s husband &#8212; that her feeding tube should be removed &#8212; and of her parents &#8212; that Terry&#8217;s life should be prolonged. What I can&#8217;t understand is Congress&#8217;s need to involve themselves in this case. The involvement of the Federal and Florida Legislatures is a simple violation of both Terry and Michael&#8217;s rights, and a frightening violation of the seperation of powers enshrined in our Constitution. Per the decision of several courts, Terry should have her feeding tube immediately removed. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001363.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
