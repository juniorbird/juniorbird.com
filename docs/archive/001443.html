				<p>It&#8217;s day three of a three-day weekend. And have I chilled out any? Of course not. I spent a whole day on activities. I spent a whole day paying bills and taking care of un-attended-to tasks. I&#8217;m in the midst of spending a whole day trying to get a summer job. TiVo has about 30GB of stuff I&#8217;d love to watch but Dean Voigt has a lot more stuff I need to do. Yes, it&#8217;s clear, what I really need is an intern.</p>

<p>The problem is, I&#8217;m getting bogged down in all the little things: shopping for household products, paying taxes, reading cases, making my <a href="http://brenditabonita.blogspot.com">girlfriend</a> feel valued, eating, etc. What I really need to be doing is getting a good night&#8217;s sleep, watching World&#8217;s Wildest Police Videos, and drinking vodka tonics.</p>

<p>An intern is the obvious solution to my problem. A nubile young <span class="caps">USC </span>undergrad could gain invaluable perspective on the whole business school process, plus great connections with deans and director-level staff that  said intern could leverage into a greater chance of admission.</p>

<p>And, from my point of view, I could have someone who could help me out with tasks like mailing bills, figuring out that whole Brazil visa thing, tell me what I&#8217;m having for lunch, and keep track of the three projects, one presentation, and five tests that I have in the next 21 days. Because that&#8217;s way too much work for me to remember without having need of a padded room.</p>
