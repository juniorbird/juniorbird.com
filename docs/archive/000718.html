				<p>The very first domain name I bought was cleverbird.com. Back in &#8216;98 I was working on a sideline project with Alan, the guy I bought Junior from, to sell high-end bird toys online. Someone  suggested the name Cleverbird, which fit perfectly. There was even a great logo. But I had other things to do and, soon enough, Alan took his own store online. Cleverbird sat still for a few years; especially after the cost of owning a domain name for a year fell under $10, there was no reason not to keep the domain around for when I might need it.</p>

<p>When I decided to play around with <a href="http://python.org">python</a> during the summer, I thought cleverbird.com would be a good place to do it. But my python efforts never led to an operational application, so cleverbird never took off.</p>

<p>The way I decided to learn python, however, was interesting: I thought it would be fun to set up and run a python-powered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">wiki</a>. Wikis are great for organizing and interlinking information. Why not use said wiki to keep track of what I learned at Marshall? So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing. If I can&#8217;t learn some python, at least I can learn some wiki &#8212; and keep track of useful info.</p>

<p>So, check it out. And, hey, it&#8217;s a collaborative site; if you&#8217;ve got something to add, edit it on! Visit <a href="http://cleverbird.com">cleverbird.com</a>.</p>
