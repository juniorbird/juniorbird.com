				<p>My latest purchase: low-fat cranberry juice sweetened with this stuff called Splenda. It&#8217;s apparently made directly from sugar, but doesn&#8217;t contain a lot of the stuff in sugar. This being the first time that I realized that sugar contained anything besides, well, sugar.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sketchy about the whole low-fat thing. Eating healthy is all about making the right choices, and making low-fat products only allows us to avoid making those choices. And then, when low-fat is not convenient, we don&#8217;t know how to exercise restraint and eat right. My friend, for example. He&#8217;s been trying to lose weight since high school! Half his diet is low-fat Healthy Choice or Weight Watchers pasta. And, each time I see him eat pasta, he puts about a quarter cup or Kraft Parmesan Cheese on it. See? Bad choices from bad fundamentals.</p>

<p>So I usually avoid reduced-fat, trying to eat instead things that are fundamentally low in fat. But, I&#8217;ve got this wack-ass diet in which I can&#8217;t have (among other things) corn syrup. And let me tell you, everything&#8217;s sweetened with corn syrup. Mustard, even. So I get a lot of diet stuff, because it&#8217;s all sweetened with NutraSweet or some such.</p>

<p>Now, I hate NutraSweet. I can taste it in food, and it tastes, to me, kinda like dirt. So diet soda is sweet and sandy. Sandy&#8217;s fun for nobody. Unless it&#8217;s that girl Sandy from college &mdash; yowza! I jumped on that Splenda-sweetened juice, and it&#8217;s not bad. A little cloying and lacking in depth of favor. Moderately acceptable. There&#8217;ll be more Splenda in my life, at least for the next month or so.</p>
