				<p>I&#8217;m back in Thailand, whose traffic had <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002679.php">scared me a bit</a>, it&#8217;s true, and I&#8217;m still surprised to see the oncoming traffic on my right, not my left, but the fact is that there are lights at the intersections here, and everyone&#8217;s instrument cluster works (how does the entire population of Vietnam get along without a single working gas gauge or dipstick?) so I must be back in civilization! We&#8217;ll see later when I take a moto ride with a friend who I&#8217;ve unexpectedly discovered is living in Chiang Mai.</p>

<p>But, rather than going on and on about Chiang Mai and my flight here &#8212; which was exceedingly comfortable and provided by the courteous and English-speaking staff of <a href="http://bangkokair.com/">Bangkok Air</a> &#8212; I&#8217;d better sum up the last two days of ruin-viewing at Siem Reap, seat of Cambodia&#8217;s unforgettable Angkor Wat and related temples.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s always hard to imagine what to say about ruins. Often, they&#8217;re unbelievable, filled with fascination and unequalled art; just as often, they&#8217;re dull. The ruins of the Angkor civilization were neither. On my second day visiting the ruins, I got to see the mysterious smiling faces of the Bayon, a temple projecting serene Buddhist acceptance; the Terrace of Elephants, shockingly lined by carvings of Elephants; the beautiful and massive Ta Keo temple, abandoned right before completion when it was, inauspiciously, hit by lightning; the incredible, early, brick Prasat Kravan; and the mysterious Preah Khan, twin to Ta Prohm, also overgrown by the jungle. Yeah, you keep all those names straight!</p>

<p>The rainy season showed us it was here, too: the afternoons of the second and third days brought rain, but on the second day it was a true downpour, flooding paths and especially the hallways and rooms of the temples &#8212; the Angkorian Khmer, you see, built their doors with foot-high jambs all around. Fortunately, the rain also washed away the innumerable children aggressively selling tchotchkes, t-shirts, cold drinks, and scarves.</p>

<p>On the third day, we ranged a bit further, seeing temples away from the major &#8220;small circuit&#8221; that comprises the essentially mandatory temples around Angkor Wat. Morning brought the deep and stunning bas-reliefs at Banteay Srei, the well-preserved but quiet burial ground of Banteay Samrei, the thousand-year-old stucco artwork at Preah Ko, and the sky-high Bakong, looking down over the whole ancient site. We even made it to far-away Lolei, in the midst of an ancient reservoir, now turned to rice paddies.</p>

<p>I finished it all up with a sour fish soup, both traditional and quite tasty. There was more to see at Chiang Mai &#8212; museums of culture and war, artwork, and even many temples, some ancient, some new, but that was just three days and I&#8217;m out of time. So, now, Chiang Mai, where it&#8217;s already pleasantly cool. I think I&#8217;m in for a change!</p>
