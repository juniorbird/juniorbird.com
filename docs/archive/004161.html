				<p>So <a href="http://juniorbird.com/4144/trying-out-vim-or-when-the-geek-says-get-off-my/">about six months ago I tried switching to Vim</a>. At first I loved it: all the customizations I could do! Then I hated it: all the customizations I needed to do! Now I&#8217;ve realized: all the customizations I&#8217;d need to do to get to the level of productivity I want to have! I really need something that I find delightful to use as close as possible to the minute I launch it. Any suggestions?</p><p>Here&#8217;s what I want: something nice to work with. And by &#8220;work&#8221; I mean &#8220;work with Javascript &#8212; chiefly jQuery and Google Analytics stuff &#8212; <span class="caps">HTML, CSS, </span>and (mostly Wordpress) <span class="caps">PHP.</span>&#8221; and by &#8220;nice&#8221; I mean &#8220;I&#8217;ve spent years working in <span class="caps">GUI</span>s, and the rest of my workflow is in <span class="caps">GUI </span>apps that use things like the system clipboard, and I need whatever I&#8217;m working in to play nicely with both my existing reflexes and the other apps I work with. Seriously, Command/Control-C and Command/Control-V aren&#8217;t optional.&#8221;</p><p>Oh, and it would be great if it&#8217;s cross-platform, so that I can use it at home (Mac) and at work (Windows). But that&#8217;s not required: I&#8217;ll do one app in one place and the other in the other, if that&#8217;s what it takes. I&#8217;ll buy something commercial, too, particularly to make it so that I&#8217;m really, really happy doing my hobby coding at home.</p><p>I&#8217;ve done some poking around, and here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve figured out:</p><ul><li>Vim and Emacs seem to be out. I&#8217;d otherwise be happy to try Emacs, but the reality is that I don&#8217;t do enough coding to justify re-learning the key commands for cut and paste for just my coding work.</li><li>My old favorite <span class="caps">BBE</span>dit is looking a little rusty and I&#8217;m not particularly excited to give it a try</li><li>I didn&#8217;t love the old version of <a href="http://macrabbit.com/espresso/">Espresso</a> but <a href="http://macrabbit.com/espresso/releasenotes/">the new version</a> looks pretty convincing</li><li>I hate to commit to something right before it gets a new version, but <a href="http://www.panic.com/coda/">Panic&#8217;s Coda has always looked intriguing</a></li><li><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text, and especially its MiniMap</a> look like something I could try</li><li>I don&#8217;t use Rails, but <a href="http://aptana.com/products/studio3">Aptana has some serious buzz</a></li><li><a href="http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/screenshots.html">Bluefish is a little terrifying</a> but does specifically include &#8220;Wordpress&#8221; as a language, which might be handy</li></ul><p>So, internets, any thoughts on those tools? Any other recommendations? And, yes, please feel free to flame over me dumping Vim/snubbing Emacs.</p>

                    <p>Sublime Text 2 is highly extensible once you install Package Control. <br />
 <br />
I&#039;ve switched mostly to that (except I do use Eclipse at work, but more because our projects are heavily Ant and Java related) for web stuff. <br />
 <br />
Before that I was using e-text editor (Win) and TextMate (Mac) which use a compatible package system for add ons. Both worth having. </p>

                    <p>My Mac install of emacs supports âŒ˜-C/X/V, as well as a number of other incantations using the Command key.  (The Meta key is Option, and obviously Ctrl is itself, which leaves Command free to add even more functionality.) </p>
