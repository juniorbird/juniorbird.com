							<h3>Thanksgiving</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov 24, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_otherwise_uncategorized.html">Otherwise Uncategorized</a></p>
						    	
							<p><span class="caps">OK, </span>so I&#8217;m <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002086.php">stressed out</a> and I may have <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001894.php">bitten off too much</a> (with <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001977.php">predictable consequences</a>). But it&#8217;s easy to overlook how much I have to be thankful for. It&#8217;s been a good year, and I can&#8217;t let the daily distractions (and nips) hide these from me. So what am I thankful for? <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002088.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>No Sleep 'Til Brooklyn</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov 24, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_otherwise_uncategorized.html">Otherwise Uncategorized</a></p>
						    	
							<p>The timestamp attached to this post is a bit deceptive; I&#8217;ve actually been up since 5am. And that&#8217;s how my week&#8217;s been, folks, with the same story for the week before. It&#8217;s not generic <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000047.php">morningsomonia</a>, and it&#8217;s not, remarkably, a generic worry about how much I have to get done. Instead, I&#8217;ve woken up early thinking <em>specific</em> thoughts about <em>specific</em> projects, consumed by <em>specific</em> worries about <em>specific</em> deliverables. Which sucks, because, let&#8217;s face it, when you wake up at 5am and realize that Godiva Chocolates might be a good comparable for doing a valuation of Peet&#8217;s Coffee, there&#8217;s nothing that will get that idea out of your head other than logging onto <a href="http://www.onesource.com/">OneSource</a> and grabbing Godiva&#8217;s financials. And, when you discover that Godiva is really a subsidiary of Campbell&#8217;s Soup, well, there&#8217;s no getting back to sleep. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002086.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Suggestions In/Suggestions Out</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov 13, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_otherwise_uncategorized.html">Otherwise Uncategorized</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Some time ago, I <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001863.php">asked you all to suggest some TV shows I might watch</a>. Y&#8217;all done good. I thought I&#8217;d return the favor with some brief feedback on your suggestions, and ask you for a few more suggestions. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002059.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Dear Person Who Stole My Trash Can Again</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov 11, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_dear_so-and-so.html">Dear So-And-So</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Thanks for taking my trash can from directly in front of my house. It sure was unsightly, especially since it was black and my house is white; the contrast was just awful. Thank goodness it&#8217;s gone now! If only I just had some place to put my trash, my kitchen garbage is sure getting full! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002055.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Butter-Related Guilt</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov 10, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_food.html">Food</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I won again this week; my masala chicken was spicy and flavorful and had a spectacular sauce. Ahh, that was a fine sauce. But there was one problem: The sauce was made with cream. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002051.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>1-800-Autopsy</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov 10, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Did you know that less than 2% of the people who die in hospitals are autopsied? That the autopsy rate has been dropping for the last 40 years? That all of this could somehow end up making somebody money? Me neither! But that&#8217;s who we met in class today, East <span class="caps">LA&#8217;</span>s own Vidal Herrera, former <span class="caps">CSI, </span>autopsy tech, and founder of 1-800-Autopsy. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002049.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Dear System Administrator</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov  5, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a>, <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_dear_so-and-so.html">Dear So-And-So</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Thank you for capping my mailbox size at 45 megabytes. I very much appreciate the periodic message telling me that I&#8217;ve used up all of my space and can neither send nor receive any messages. I particularly appreciate how you bounce back any mail sent to me, returning it to the sender with a cryptic error message. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002038.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
