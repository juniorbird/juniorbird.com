				<p>I&#8217;ve been tagged to do a meme like twice before, and I always say I&#8217;ll write something for it, but then I never do. Maybe I should start. So, as much as I hate <a href="http://millatimes.com">Milla</a> for tagging me,<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003138.html#fn1">1</a></sup> well, maybe it&#8217;s good for me too. Well, good or a source of relatively free writing ideas. So, without further ado, five things that I think none of my regular readers knows about me.</p>


<ol>
<li>When I was in fifth grade, I carried a notebook around with me everywhere outside of school. Inside, I wrote an entire science fiction novel. It&#8217;s easy to write a novel when each chapter is less than a page and consists of entirely exposition. I guess that Isaac Asimov was my hero.</li>
<li>One semester in college, I had romantic opportunities with three brunettes from Chicago; I picked just one. The next semester, I had romantic opportunities with three blondes from Massachusetts; I picked just one there as well. In fact, all through college, I only dated one girl from California. I&#8217;m not sure how that happened, and I&#8217;m particularly not sure how one semester was all about Chicago and the other all about Massachusetts. </li>
<li>One day in junior high I taped <em>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</em> off of the <span class="caps">TV.</span> I watched that tape over and over again on weekends until it wore out and skipped incessantly. Now, I own both versions of that move on <span class="caps">DVD.</span></li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t listen to music at all until 9th grade, when I got a <a href="http://www.kix-band.com/">Kix</a> tape as a gift. I think my parents got me a cheap stereo to play it on. Well, with just one tape, that sure got a lot of listening! (Fortunately I liked Kix. This was before they got a little crazy and wondered, in an article in the Sun, why they weren&#8217;t bigger than Led Zeppelin, since they were better. I guess having Poison steal your show and then get famous off it would drive anyone insane.)</li>
<li>I once made out with one of my college newspaper&#8217;s photographers in the darkroom. We managed not to screw up any film processing! I was very happy, as I&#8217;d had a big crush on her for a long time, but it took me about six weeks to kiss her again, and that never did go anywhere.</li>
</ol>



<p>You know, that wasn&#8217;t so bad; I&#8217;d even do it again for another meme. I think I&#8217;m supposed to tag somebody. Ummm&#8230;. Mary and Auros, you&#8217;re it!</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> I plan to get back at her by pronouncing her name &#8220;Mill-uh&#8221; rather than &#8220;Mee-la&#8221; the next time I see her.</p>

                    <p>Two versions of Wrath of Khan?  You mean, like, widescreen and fullscreen?  Or is there actually a director&#8217;s cut somewhere?  (I know there is for the first film, but I hadn&#8217;t heard of that, for II.)</p>

                    <p>There is, indeed, a director&#8217;s cut. Doesn&#8217;t include all of the content from the Alan Smithee TV version, but that&#8217;s not always a bad thing.</p>
