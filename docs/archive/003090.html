				<p>I&#8217;ve been writing this thing for three and a half years now. I started blogging because everything I wrote sounded like a business memo, and that just wasn&#8217;t a good way to make date plans; now, I can write things that are occasionally amusing. And have long run-on sentences and snarky footnotes.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003090.html#fn1">1</a></sup> Yep, things are moving along.</p>

<p>But, as much as I&#8217;d like to complain about minor customer service errors and politics and threaten football team owners in every entry, it&#8217;s probably time I tried writing, you know, better. So here&#8217;s the plan. A friend gave me this thing, <a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1577311000/ref=nosim/wadearmstrong-20"><em>A Writer&#8217;s Book of Days</em></a>. This book has a thing to write about for every day, and I think it would be a good idea if I tried it out. You know, to get out of my comfort zone.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll keep writing about things that particularly strike me, but you can expect a good 3 posts a week that are just from out of nowhere. So, consider this entry some kind of fair warning.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003090.html#fn2">2</a></sup></p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> And let&#8217;s not even talk about how many times I can use &#8220;and&#8221; in two senteces. Grammar, pshaw!</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> I actually wasn&#8217;t going to write an entry about how I was going to do this, but instead was just going to write today&#8217;s assignment. Today&#8217;s assignment was &#8220;write a love letter&#8221; and I figured I&#8217;d write one to Drew Barrymore, but that pretty quickly got weird and I figured I should explain what I was doing before both of my regular readers called the men in white coats on me.</p>
