				<p>My dad&#8217;s screwing up my habits. I like sitting on my tree, grooming myself, then climb down to sit down on his lap while he sits on the couch. For two years, I&#8217;ve been able to cilmb to the low branch on my tree, tell him what a pretty bird I am, and get armpit scratchies from my dad, then climb down onto the couch and my dad&#8217;s lap and get kisses and scratches on the top of my wing. That&#8217;s just how I like it. But lately, he&#8217;s been sitting on the chair on the other side of my tree, and I don&#8217;t know how to get scratchies from him there!</p>

<p>When I&#8217;m a good bird and I talk nice, saying things like &#8220;pretty bird!&#8221; and &#8220;hello!&#8221; and &#8220;how are you?&#8221; my dad will take me out into the living room. This is what the living room looks like:</p>

<p><img src="/images/juniortree/thepanorama.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>See, that&#8217;s my tree in the middle. I can sit on the top and groom myself and just hang out while my dad sits on the brown couch, which is what he always used to do. Then, I could climb down to see him:</p>

<p><img src="/images/juniortree/thesofa.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Look at that &#8212; there&#8217;s the low branch on the tree, the one I can climb on to so that dad can easily reach me to scratch me, the one that&#8217;s even low enough that I can climb from it onto the arm of the couch. I love that branch, it&#8217;s even low enough that if I say &#8220;gimme a kiss!&#8221; dad will lean over and kiss me.</p>

<p>The branch on the other side of the tree, however, is not as perfect. It&#8217;s too high, I can&#8217;t get all the way over to dad and he can&#8217;t reach up to scratch me there:</p>

<p><img src="/images/juniortree/thechair.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>See, that&#8217;s just hard to get to. Plus, that was the branch I always went to when I wanted to be alone! You know, in the same room but alone. Maybe with the occasional &#8220;hello!&#8221; or a big stretch to say I was happy and comfy there, but didn&#8217;t need to cuddle. But now dad&#8217;s over on that side, in the chair, and it&#8217;s all wrong. I wish my dad would just go and sit in the couch again, but it seems like he&#8217;s a lot more comfortable on the chair with his computer on his lap; and since he&#8217;s been working on this blog and <a href="http://wadearmstrong.com">his other blog</a> and that <a href="http://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails thing</a> he keeps on talking about so much, it seems like the chair is the best place for him.</p>

<p>So I guess that means I&#8217;d better either get used to going over to the other side of the tree, or dad has to move it. I hope he moves it! Maybe he could turn the tree around and put the low branch on the other side so that it&#8217;s easy to get to the chair? Of course then I&#8217;d have to figure out what to do about the couch, but, frankly, dad would probably be happy since I wouldn&#8217;t be able to climb down onto the couch and sneak up behind all the friends he brings home and climb onto their shoulders. Maybe he&#8217;ll read this blog entry and decide to try it!</p>

                    <p>Junior,</p>

<p>I would like to commend you on three things:</p>

<p>1) You were able to explain the couch-tree-chair conundrum with much greater clarity than your dad. Well done!</p>

<p>2) Your solution to the perch problem is brilliant simplicity. You are a good bird, but I bet some of your dad?s friends would not like to be surprised by you climbing on their shoulders. And I?ll even bet some of his friends are physically reactive people. A sneaky, pretty bird like you coupled with one of the afore mentioned humans seems like a potentially volatile combination. So why not avoid sneak attacks when possible?!</p>

<p>3) Even though you type with your beak (at least I assume you do), you did better on typos than your dad usually does. Stand tall! </p>

<p>- C</p>
