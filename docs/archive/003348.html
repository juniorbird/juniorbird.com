				<p>About a month ago, my desk lamp in my office quit working. I figured it burnt out, so I changed the lightbulb, but there was no more light with the new bulb than with the old. Sadly, I classified my &#8217;50s-style lamp as dead. Then, today, the light in my kitchen went out. I replaced the bulb but: nothing. So I washed the dishes in the dark, and vowed to call the landlord tomorrow, when he was in the office.</p>

<p>I was sad to see my lamp go, but not too surprised &#8212; I&#8217;d bought it for just $10 when I was poor and launching my first start-up. Of course it would die when I&#8217;m poor and launching my second! But the ceiling light in my kitchen was new when I moved in, and, let&#8217;s face it, household fixtures are designed to last longer than $10 lamps. Was it that my lights were out to get me? Was this some conspiracy to get me to bed early?</p>

<p>So I decided to live on the edge: I took the new lightbulb out of the kitchen light, and put in <em>another new lightbulb</em>. Then I turned the light on. And I could see!</p>

<p>Oh yeah, I forgot to wash the wooden spoon I used on Tuesday. Oops. That looked better with the lights off.</p>

<p>And then it occurred to me: maybe it wasn&#8217;t the <em>lights</em> that were out to get me, maybe it was the light <em>bulbs</em>. So, three or more weeks after giving up on it, I got a new lightbulb out and put it in my desk lamp. <em>And again, there was light.</em> It was my lightbulbs &#8212; my brand-new, pristine 16-pack from Target. The good stuff, actually, real GE rather than generics.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t believe I was being betrayed. By a brand name! I looked askance at the remaining 15 bulbs, hiding under my kitchen sink. Traitors.</p>

<p>But a memory slowly bubbled to the top. Was it possible&#8230; could I have&#8230; when I replaced the bulb in my office, and I declared the lamp dead&#8230; did I? Yes, I must have&#8230; <em>I put the new bulb back</em>. Because it was new. And I didn&#8217;t want to waste it. And that bulb had gone into my kitchen lamp, and I&#8217;d thought the lamp dead. So it wasn&#8217;t all the bulbs &#8212; it was this one bulb. This one traitor, this one fifth column. And now that bulb&#8217;s in my kitchen trash, with the fruit cores and those leftovers I should&#8217;ve eaten two weeks ago. And I&#8217;ve left all of my lights on, because I can, because the lightbulbs &#8212; now they do what I say. </p>

                    <p>Do I really have to do that for the old-fashioned incandescents, too?</p>

<p>Hmm, I hadn&#8217;t thought about it, but it&#8217;s a pity to throw away all those useful elements. I&#8217;ll see if I can find a recycler nearby.</p>
