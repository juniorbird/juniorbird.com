				<p>I&#8217;m very happy that I took the time to learn a little bit of Portuguese before traveling to Brazil. Having the ability to understand, and to communicate with, many of the people I met there really improved my trip. Of course, it also got me stuck riding in the front of cabs and talking to cabbies, so it wasn&#8217;t all upside.</p>

<p>Now, I&#8217;ll freely admit that it&#8217;s easier for an American to learn Portuguese than it is to learn, say, Mandarin; there are big advantages to working in the Roman alphabet, just for starters. And it was particularly easier for me since I already spoke French (well) and Spanish (poorly).</p>

<p>The Spanish was useful because many words are the same in the two languages, but Spanish has the disadvantage of being pronounced like it&#8217;s written, whereas Portuguese has either 2 or 3 (depending on how you count) &#8220;r&#8221;s, you say &#8220;de&#8221; as &#8220;j&#8221;, &#8220;m&#8221; as &#8220;n&#8221;, and many &#8220;o&#8221;s are pronounced as &#8220;u&#8221;. This is a lot like French, which is not at all phonetic, so French got me ready for the difficult pronouncing part. Both languages prepared me for the grammar and cadence of Portuguese.</p>

<p>It was really easy to learn the little bit of Portuguese that I did learn; a friend and I just split the cost of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0671572865/">Pimsleur Brazilian Portuguese I</a>, and I did one lesson a day for a few weeks. Good practice and fun.</p>

<p>And it was useful! I was able to go out and walk around on my own regularly, and it was easy for me to communicate with servers, vendors, etc. I could figure out what the cabbies were saying, and, when they wouldn&#8217;t seat us at that one bar, I could understand that it was because there was a private party there. </p>

<p>In sum, I&#8217;d highly recommend anyone going on a <span class="caps">PRIME </span>trip to learn a little of the language of the country to which they&#8217;re going. It made my trip more fun, and it will make it more fun when I go back to visit Chile and Brazil on my own.</p>
