							<h3>Good News: Bailout Voted Down</h3>
							<p class="date">Sep 29, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_elsewhere.html">Elsewhere</a></p>
							
							<p>So they voted down the bailout. Thank goodness! The last-offered plan was a bad one that would be expensive and not solve any problems over the long term. Let&#8217;s hope that there&#8217;s room for fast response to the crisis with a good, equitable, and market-based idea this time.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/business/good_news_bailout_voted_down.php">Read on&#8230;</a>
						
									
				
					
				
							<h3>The More Things Change, the More They (Hopefully) Stay the Same</h3>

							<p>You may have noticed that it was impossible to comment here for a while. Then, if you follow very closely, you may have noticed that things looked a little funny here for a while. I&#8217;d like to say that was &#8220;growing pains&#8221; but really it was &#8220;middle-aged creaky pains.&#8221; The upshot is that this blog has been updated to <a href="http://movabletype.com/overview/">Movable Type 4.21</a> and everything should be better than ever now. Hopefully not in the way that a 47-year-old guy buys a Boxster to distract himself from creaky knees that give him a big old 1&#8221; vertical leap at the gym basketball court. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003726.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Starring Michael Cera and Ellen Page</h3>
							<p class="date">Sep 18, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_dreams.html">Dreams</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Michael Cera&#8217;s character runs cross-country; he&#8217;s counting on his coach to get him a college scholarship. It&#8217;s a good thing that his coach is having a big recruiting day for all the area cross-country standouts on Thursday &#8212; all the college scouts will be watching! Or at least that&#8217;s what Mikey<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003721.html#fn1">1</a></sup> thinks, the coach is actually a charlatan. With that great slack-jawed look that Cera can do, Mikey discovers that he needs to fill the event with some kind of ringers, or the scouts will be pissed off and not give him a chance. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003721.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Opa! Ouzo!</h3>

							<p>It&#8217;s not too late, you can still make it to the <a href="http://www.lagreekfest.com/">LA Greek Fest</a> and enjoy the food, rides, and booze. If you&#8217;ve been down near <span class="caps">USC </span>you&#8217;ve probably noticed <a href="http://www.stsophia.org/">St. Sophia Orthodox Cathedral</a> at Pico and Normandie. I had no idea they had a Greek festival there every year but the <span class="caps">AIG </span>heard about it on the radio at the gym this morning and, let&#8217;s face it, the prospect of grilled lamb is way too much for either of us to pass up. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003718.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Lemons, Lemonade, You Know the Drill</h3>

							<p>A little too much on the old to-do list has made this vacation weekend a little less than a vacation chez Juniorbird.com. I could see it was heading for twilight on a bright Labor Day when I finished the last task, and I&#8217;d been wanting to shoot all weekend long. With nothing to do at the last minute I thought of the old saying in the title and headed for the lemon tree in the backyard. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003717.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
