				<p>Ever since I got back from <span class="caps">PRIME, </span>people have complimented me on my sagacity in traveling to Brazil. &#8220;Wow,&#8221; they say, &#8220;weren&#8217;t those Brazilian chicks hot?&#8221; And all I can do is sigh, because, no, Brazilian women aren&#8217;t really more attractive than American women.</p>

<p>I realize that&#8217;s an unpopular opinion to hold. The reputation of Brazilian women is, certainly, that they are incredibly beautiful. They are supposed to have perfect bodies, sun-kissed skin, wear skimpy thongs, and have incredible bikini waxes. <span class="caps">OK,</span> I have no personal knowledge of the last factor, but I can speak to the other three.</p>

<p>There are spectacularly beautiful Brazilian women, it&#8217;s true. But I&#8217;m not convinced that there are proportionally more beautiful women in Brazil than there are in the <span class="caps">US.</span> I do think that three things are true:</p>


<ul>
<li>Brazilian women show off what they have more &#8212; all the pants are tight and the shirts revealing, to say nothing of the thongs on the beach. Great on a pretty young thing, not so great on your average fifty-year-old.</li>
<li>Brazilian women know how to move. It&#8217;s a culture that incorporates dancing from an early age, so everyone walking down the street knows how to walk and everyone in every club knows how to dance.</li>
<li>Brazilian women are bootylicious. They&#8217;ve got curves. Especially in the trunk area.</li>
</ul>



<p>This all adds up to a fine product. But how do they stack up to the  local &#8220;talent&#8221;?</p>


<ul>
<li>If you like straight hair, America&#8217;s your town.</li>
<li>American women have, on average, more beautiful faces.</li>
<li>Certainly, Brazil is an ethnically diverse place, but there are still a wider variety of looks in the <span class="caps">US.</span></li>
</ul>



<p>So, in sum, Brazilian women are exotic, they&#8217;re different, they&#8217;re fun, and they sure can move, but they&#8217;re not spectacularly more beautiful than American women. No, we can all do just fine staying at home.</p>

<p>Still, I&#8217;d go to Brazil for the carne seca. Now that&#8217;s something special.</p>
