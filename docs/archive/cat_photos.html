							<p>Occasionally someone compliments my <a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com">photography</a>. Misguided though such a sentiment may be, there are a few specific items that I would recommend anyone interested in taking better shots buy. Since it&#8217;s the holiday season, why not help yourself to one of these?<br />

							<h3>Own Private <s>Idaho</s> Island</h3>

							<p>Counting down to the end of our honeymoon, we had to do something incredible to close out such an outstanding vacation. Fortunately, <a href="http://lalati-fiji.com">Lalati</a> offered just such a package, and at the outrageously low price typical of the venue &#8212; a day away at a private, secluded beach, with picnic lunch, booze, and two one-hour massages per person. Frankly, we&#8217;d been looking forward to this high point since we started to research the resort, and getting out there and getting it done was essential; being blocked by high winds on Thursday, when we&#8217;d planned to go out, only increased our determination. Friday, we finally made it, paddling our kayaks with more than a little dispatch as we worked our way to the beach even before the motorboat would have arrived to take us there. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003843.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Bula from Fiji!</h3>
							<p class="date">Oct 22, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_photos.html">Photos</a>, <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_travel.html">Travel</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Coke is made with real sugar in both New Zealand and Fiji, which, if you know me well, you know is a big priority. But there are other good things about Fiji, too. Specifically: the relaxing. And: the activities related to relaxing. And then: the activities that burn off any excess energy so that I can get back to relaxing. </p>

<p>The flip side of all this is that I&#8217;m not having much of that delicious sugar-sweetened Coke here, since, well, who needs caffeine to get in the way of that all-important relaxing? Oh, and I do apologize for the lateness of this entry, but blogging and photo editing was getting in the way of the relaxing. And, if you had the view from your veranda that I have from mine, you&#8217;d want to focus on the relaxing too. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003842.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>An Ending Fit For a Queen</h3>

							<p>So this is it&#8230; the last morning in New Zealand. Not too many tears; this afternoon we head for Fiji. We ended with four nights &#8212; our longest stop yet &#8212; in Queenstown, the premier tourist destination in New Zealand and largest city in the area. We arrived with an equal mix of exhaustion and determination to avail ourselves of the adrenalin-fueled sports the area&#8217;s famous for. Plus food, wine, fun. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003841.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Sailing Doubtful Sound</h3>

							<p>Everyone says that you need to spend time on New Zealand&#8217;s famous sounds, Milford Sound and Doubtful Sound (both of which are, in fact, fjords rather than sounds). Doubtful Sound is the more remote, difficult, and vast destination; of course, we had to go there. Of course, that meant more driving. But, fortunately, at the end of this drive was a boat, taking us through an overnight cruise far, far away from pretty much anything else in this world. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003840.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Three Days in Wanaka; Or, Finally Three Days Somewhere</h3>
							<p class="date">Oct 13, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_photos.html">Photos</a>, <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_travel.html">Travel</a></p>
						    	
							<p>While the drive to Wanaka was long, and rainy, and, worse than both, unexpectedly so, such that it sapped our energy, the fact is that Wanaka might be our favorite place in New Zealand so far. Wanaka is the red-headed stepchild of the nearby, and much more famous, Queenstown. Both towns are on a beautiful lake, both have a gold-mining history, both offer great outdoor options nearby, but Queenstown is much larger. I&#8217;m not sure about Queenstown yet, but Wanaka was beautiful, cute, filled with friendly people and good meals, and a great time all around. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003839.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Crossing New Zealand, to Punakaki and the Franz Josef Glacier</h3>

							<p>We left Christchurch driving in the opposite direction of Kaikoura, not that we were sad to do so with the rain and cold coming down from the north. Originally, the plan was to take the legendarily spectacular <a href="http://www.tranzscenic.co.nz/services/tranzalpine.aspx">TranzAlpine train</a> to cross the Southern Alps, but they&#8217;re doing track maintenance while we&#8217;re in the country, so we drove the route instead &#8212; and I can hardly imagine that it was much less spectacular. Our destination was an overnight stop at Punakaki, home of the famous Pancake Rocks, and another overnighter at the Franz Josef Glacier. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003838.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Fresh off the heels of an incredible stay in Kaikoura, we headed back to Christchurch for another stay at the Hotel So, plus the chance to enjoy the city&#8217;s sights a bit. Soon we&#8217;ll be gadding about the country, doing all sorts of damn-fool things, so our last day in Christchurch has been a bit of a relaxing time for us &#8212; sleep in, have a nice breakfast, see the sights. And it&#8217;s a good thing it&#8217;s a nice, mellow day, because we barely made it here. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003836.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>The Part of the Honeymoon That You Hate Me For</h3>

							<p>Based on past experience, we knew that we needed to relax, catch our breath, and get a few nights&#8217; solid sleep before we could really appreciate our honeymoon. Also based on past experience, we knew that we wouldn&#8217;t allow ourselves to make such passive choices unless there was really very little else to do <strong>and</strong> we were also in a brilliant place. That&#8217;s why we planned ourselves a nice splurge for the beginning of our honeymoon. We got out of Christchurch for a couple of days, drove north to Kaikoura, and stayed outside of town at a quiet lodge instead of our usual downtown hotel will small, reasonably-priced rooms. Specifically, we stayed in a treehouse at the <a href="http://www.hapukulodge.com/">Hapuku Lodge</a>.  Go ahead, click on that link, we might as well get the you hating me started so that we can be on the same page. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003835.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I&#8217;ve been bad about blogging. Very, very bad. For about the last year. I know, I&#8217;m sorry, please come back gentle readers; I plan to post a lot more now. You see, at first I didn&#8217;t feel like I had much of anything to say; then my inspiration came back, but it was joined by a new business and, most of all, by being engaged. And, if you want to find an excuse to give up all your hobbies and free time, let me tell you, getting married is it. DJ L&#8217;il Bit &#8212; now, I guess, Mrs. DJ L&#8217;il Bit! &#8212; and I spent a quick 18 weeks planning two weddings, and then we got married, and now we&#8217;re on our honeymoon, and finally I have time to say something in. So, let me say: ha-ha, I&#8217;m in New Zealand and you&#8217;re not! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003834.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Clarifying a Photo From The Past</h3>

							<p>Last year, there was a small confusion about a photo published on this site. In particular, a regular reader thought that <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003690.html">a ring previously displayed on DJ L&#8217;il Bit&#8217;s hand</a> was an engagement ring &#8212; a reasonable enough thought, since it&#8217;s a pretty ring, but I wouldn&#8217;t buy her a $35 ring from Overstock.com for that purpose. I thought that was worth clarifying, especially since&#8230; well, I&#8217;ll let the photo here speak for itself: <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003821.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Garment District</h3>

							<p>LA has a major clothing industry (&agrave; la American Apparel) and everyone here dresses snappy-like, so I probably should&#8217;ve been to the <a href="http://www.fashiondistrict.org/">Garment District</a><sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003816.html#fn1">1</a></sup> more than two times since I came out here. There was that one time during college, when I think I expected to get some actual everyday clothes there and was, instead, baffled by the cheap t-shirts and couture. I also went on Saturday, to meet my extremely <a href="http://jasminedelgado.com/">talented friend</a> and walk around and shoot for a few hours. Because, you know, photography&#8217;s like everything else; the more you do it, the better you are at it. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003816.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

L8s Ang3les is a show featuring 11 local photographers, especially some from the LA times; the Annenberg Space is a brand-new gallery trying to bring some culture to the antiseptic, wealth-filled skyscraper-land that is Century City. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003814.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Sorry I&#8217;ve been so bad at posting lately &#8212; between a new job and a new project (watch for it to launch in a few weeks to a couple of months!) I haven&#8217;t had the time I should to get on the ol&#8217; Juniorbird.com. Which is also my way of saying that I may not post so much for the next few months either. Of course, the corrollary is that, the more you do, the more you do, so you may see more from me here.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003808.html#fn1">1</a></sup> But I do have something for you, something special from the cruise.  <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003808.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I like vacations. I&#8217;d actually kind of forgotten about that, but I like them. So I&#8217;ve tried to <a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel">take more lately</a>. Cruises had popped up on our radar a few months ago; prices have been dropping dramatically as cruise lines have desperately tried to keep bookings up. Looking around for things to do for Valentine&#8217;s Day, a 4-night Carnival cruise to Catalina and Ensenada was actually so cheap as to be competitive with a nice dinner out. So I bought my honey one. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003802.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>With all the <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003702.html">basil from the housewarming party</a>, I could hardly resist making all manner of pesto. The Thai basil basically dared me to make an Asian-flavored pesto, and, once made, the perfect match was clearly a simple grilled salmon. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003758.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>The summer just won&#8217;t quit here in Southern California, which means summery dishes even as the night comes sooner. A good Asian salad is a great weekend lunch or light weeknight dinner, and this recipe is pretty low-fat and responsible. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003759.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Pizza&#8217;s great, and with all the great basil we got for our <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003702.html">housewarming</a>, a pizza with pesto replacing the marinara seemed obvious. The <span class="caps">AIG </span>also has this great, old, well-seasoned grill pan that we use for just about everything, so grilling the pizza sure sounded fun.

							<p>Healthy cooking can be fun. So can unhealthy eating! Everybody loves a good lasagna, but that Italian delectable is filled with fat and calories and not exactly great for the &#8216;ol ticker. So we whipped up a meatless, cheeseless, low-carb, and otherwise trend-compliant version, semi only because we added a bit of Pecorino for some richness. It came out light and delicious! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003755.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

A neighbor a few houses down fortunately recognized him and came by carrying the little guy. Let me tell you that finding a black dog in the middle of the night did not sound like a good bet at the time and we were sure happy to see the pup. Then, as we were setting up for last night&#8217;s combined Halloween/AIG&#8217;s Birthday party, a <a href="http://identify.whatbird.com/obj/36/_/Coopers_Hawk.aspx">Cooper&#8217;s Hawk</a> suddenly swept down from the sky gunning straight for <a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/gallery/1437283_4rCYr/1/68344502_yTuCP">Junior</a>. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003745.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

I could see it was heading for twilight on a bright Labor Day when I finished the last task, and I&#8217;d been wanting to shoot all weekend long.

							<p>I moved! Did you hear? I&#8217;m renting a wonderful house with the wonderful <span class="caps">AIG </span>and, after 10 weeks, we&#8217;ve finally got the place set up. We had a great party Saturday night where many of our friends came by to see the place and <s>turn green-eyed with envy</s> have a great time and try our Spanish-style Tapas and our homemade infused vodkas. Can I show you the place? Would you like to see?<br />

							<h3>In Which I Fall Behind on My Posting 'Cause I'm Relaxing on the Beach, Suckas</h3>

							<p>I&#8217;m sorry I haven&#8217;t written! But I&#8217;ve been so, well, relaxed, and busy doing relaxing things. For instance, sleeping in. And sleeping on the beach. And sleeping next to the pool. And drinking almost every rum-based drink known to man. But I did take some pictures in between, because I care. Or, because I did wonderful things and want to make you jealous. To wit: <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003694.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>From the busy, crazy Honolulu &#8212; at least, if you ask the locals, it&#8217;s a high-stress, high-traffic place &#8212; we flew on one of those <a href="http://www.crj.bombardier.com/CRJ/en/home_crj.jsp?langId=en&amp;crjId=200">little jets made by dirty Canucks</a>, to sunny and slower Kauai. The &#8220;garden isle&#8221; of <strikethrough>Ceti Alpha 5</strikethrough> Hawaii, Kauai has a cute little airport that looks like it&#8217;s made of Lincoln Logs and is open to the air. Walking to get our rental car, we discovered that the laid-back Hertz staff had shut down for the day; but we caught a shuttle, got our car, and, despite signage that was either absent or the size of postage stamps, navigated to the hotel.<br />

							<p>Today was a very relaxing day; which was good, because we both needed it. Normally, I plan out my vacations ahead of time &#8212; learn what sites I want to see at each stop, plan out the day to make sure I hit my itinerary, and make sure my list is completed each day. But this has been a less-planned trip, and we&#8217;re trying to relax. This is what happens when two type As relax.

							<p>In the very back of my house, above the closet in my office, I have a rather deep shelf with a narrow sliding door. Over the years, I&#8217;ve managed to fill this shelf with one forgotten thing after another; naturally, the stuff that I wanted to keep all ended up sitting on the floor or in other temporary locations. But, with a 3-day weekend under my belt, I actually cleaned out the shelf. Oh, the crap that I threw away. But some of it: not so bad.

							<p>When my <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003263.html">camera got stolen</a>, I also lost the camera bag that went with it. Not so serious, since said bag was actually too small; I used it for the occasional gad about town, but, in general, I kept my body and lenses in padded containers in my backpack when out shooting. My replacement camera came with a replacement holster-style camera bag, which was good enough for the Canon with the smaller lens attached, but too small for my 300mm zoom. Hey, it&#8217;s Christmas, maybe I should ask for a camera bag that fits the zoom? I mean, I do have a dream camera bag&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003552.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>There&#8217;s this overpass crossing the 405 near me, on Palms between Sepulveda and Sawtelle. They&#8217;ve been doing something to this bridge for nearly two years now, and have blocked off half of it to traffic. Unfortunately the blocked half is the good half, visually &#8212; every time I go past at night, I see miles of the 405 stretching downhill towards <span class="caps">LAX, </span>traffic bumper-to-bumper as it is on that fine freeway, just past the wooden scaffolding that the construction crew put up. To thousands, these red and white dotted lines track the futility of their commutes; to me, they looks like great photography. Walk past the &#8220;construction - do not enter!&#8221; signs, throw in a little soft focus and shutter drag, and you get the below! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002920.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

Still, between that plan and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/harlykwin714/133078791/">Amy&#8217;s new hardware</a>, I had to get some practice in. Specifically, I had to better understand the exposure and color performance of <a href="http://amazon.com/o/ASIN/B000A7JKTA/wadearmstrong-20/ref=nosim/">my camera</a>. For a project like that, I needed a subject that had bright whites as well as dark details. Hmm, it occurred to me, I have one of those sitting next to me!

							<p>Being now a man of leisure, I took most of the day off to head downtown and take some photographs of the protest for immigrants&#8217; rights. Coincident with an immigrant boycott of all business around the country, marches like these were designed to bring the current absurd lack of meaningful policy conversation, much less reform, into the spotlight.

							<p>I haven&#8217;t shot black-and-white film since college, but, now that I&#8217;m back into photography, I&#8217;ve been itching for the chance. Well, itching and fearing it; it&#8217;s very different to shoot black-and-white than it is to shoot color. With color film, you&#8217;re trying to reporduce the world as it is, or to highlight certain juxtapositions of colors, while, for black-and-white, you&#8217;re more interested in shapes, lines, tones, and patterns. This is a different task, and, hardest of all, requires a set of thought processes that are very different from the visual thought processes that one uses when going through the world. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001979.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>My exhausted bones quailing at the thought of cutting a frozen chicken into parts or strugging with my deteriorated old stove, I walked down the street to the <a href="http://overlandcafe.com/">Overland Cafe</a> to get a turkeyburger and garlic fries. Then, turning the corner, the sky rose from behind the apartment building next door and the light of the world changed. The long blue of the evening suddenly became bright red and orange from the cloud rising above <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-093005fires_lat,0,4509311.story?coll=la-home-headlines">the fires</a>. I could almost cry, thinking of the empty camera at my home. I walked a block in dejection, but with my face turned up to look hopelessly at the wonderful sky. Finally the scene overcame me and my desperation drove me to take low-res photos with my cameraphone. Better to get something than nothing. So, not nothing below. Actually, quite a bit more than not nothing: <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001898.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>So this morning I wrote a 10-page paper. This is either a sign that I&#8217;m working really hard or that I&#8217;m a total slacker who puts big projects off &#8216;til the last minute. Since I&#8217;m finding time to blog right now, one might be inclined to pick the latter.</p>

<p>Anyway, this brings up the big question of the second year, which is: &#8220;do I work hard and learn a shitload and get out in the world ready to take on any challenge, or do I take the easiest classes I can find and try to get out of here with as much of my sanity intact as possible, given that I get the same three letters after my name either way and Marshall doesn&#8217;t report <span class="caps">GPA</span>s to potential employers?&#8221; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001894.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>One of Mexico&#8217;s most famous recent monuments (that is, excepting the Aztec and Maya ruins) is the <em>Ninos Heroes</em> in the <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/001619.php">Bosque de Chapultepec</a>. It&#8217;s a very proud monument for such a sad story. I&#8217;ve done my best to take proud, nationalist photos of it, despite being from the nation that inspired the cadets&#8217; <em>jette&eacute;</em>. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001775.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

It&#8217;s a bizarre hodgepodge of various styles of architecture, with components obviously built by experienced military men with an eye for a defensive position, and components built imitating the styles of the grand French chateaux. The Castillo has a great view of the whole city and is definitely where I&#8217;ll make my home, when I&#8217;m king. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001766.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>The <em>Bosque</em>, or forest, is a large area, around a hill, that has stood green since the time of the Aztecs, and which held the rulers of Mexico City from the time of the Conquistadors to well after the Revolution.

							<p>After driving and driving on Monday through the desert, I finally got back to my little house in the Palms neighborhood of <span class="caps">LA.</span> I&#8217;d both desperately anticipated and feared my homecoming; I was ready to leave Phoenix but I feared I&#8217;d idealized my home and would be dissapointed by its small size, its rickety construction, its lack of air conditioning, or the ghetto that surrounds it. But my homecoming was everything I&#8217;d hoped. The house was cute (if &#8220;rustic&#8221;, as was commented), it was comfortable, and the neighborhood was vibrant and filled with fun things.
