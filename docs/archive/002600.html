				<p>So did I mention that I graduated on Friday? I&#8217;m officially an <span class="caps">MBA.</span> I think the description for what I&#8217;m feeling now is &#8220;bittersweet, elated terror.&#8221; I definitely feel as if I&#8217;ve accomplished something incredible, but, gosh, the pressure to now accomplish something even more incredible is that much greater.</p>

<p>Marshall really was incredible. My brain is chock-full of new and useful concepts and ways of thinking &#8212; I can rattle on about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPV"><span class="caps">NPV</span></a>, scenario development, backup behaviors, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Target_costing">target costing</a>, <a href="http://vcexperts.com/vce/library/encyclopedia/glossary_view.asp?glossary_id=124">cramdown</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_forces">five forces</a>, and so on in myriad topics that will all bore you into a deep slumber. If you&#8217;re unlucky, you might get me talking about risk mitigation in real estate investment, or what exactly is wrong with that ad we just saw, or about the astronomical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_coefficient">beta</a> of the condo market, or even &#8212; and this is embarassing to admit &#8212; why <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webvan">Webvan&#8217;s astronomical burn rate</a> may not have been such a bad idea after all. I&#8217;ve got a ridiculously <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webvan">long list of projects</a> that could make me millions, or something. It&#8217;s really difficult to overestimate how much my thinking has changed in the last two years (hopefully this change is for the better!).</p>

<p>I had an incredible time; it really was two years of summer camp. Well, summer camp getting my ass kicked stylee. I will miss the vast majority of the people I&#8217;ve met and worked with at school, and even miss complaining about the small majority I&#8217;ll be glad to be done with. Most of all I&#8217;ll miss being in an environment of ideas scattered willy-nilly all over the place; I could always count on sitting down for lunch and running into at least one non-disastrous business idea a week. Bet I won&#8217;t get that hanging out at Starbuck&#8217;s!</p>

<p>While there are big plans on deck for me, I&#8217;ve got a regular old summer vacation ahead. That means regular old things like figuring out how to have lunch now that I won&#8217;t be sitting at <a href="http://www.usc.edu/about/visit/upc/places_to_eat/index.html">Popovich Cafe</a>, like learning how to live without my fancy-shmancy school Exchange e-mail system, and like actually having to figure out what to do tonight and tomorrow night and this weekend ad infinitum, because there&#8217;s no more homework and deadlines telling me what to do. Do you realize I got two e-mails from people today? Two? I must have been completely forgotten by the world, because who gets just two e-mails?</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll tell you the answer to that: regular old people on vacation. I&#8217;ve got no fires to put out, except for that darned health insurance that expires in a week. And it&#8217;s funny, this time last year I was prepared to tell real live <a href="http://tyco.com/">Tyco</a> execs that they should divest a lot of their companies, but I&#8217;m vacillating on the health insurance purchase. Do I want the high-deductible insurance that, if something awful happens, will pay for almost all of it? Or should I get the moderate-deductible insurance that gives me a small co-pay for preventative care but can hoover my wallet for $7500 if I get Bird Flu or something. Ah, the dilemmas of adulthood.</p>

<p>For now it&#8217;s adulthood vs. the powerful alliance of sleeping in and Tivo. It&#8217;s been two years, and frankly I want to have the time to watch stupid things that add to my life in no substantive way whatsoever. Two years is a lot of missed episodes of Cops, a lot of &#8220;no time to go out this weekend&#8221;, and a lot of five- and six-hours-of-sleep nights. I slept until 9:30 this morning, and I woke up with no fires in my inbox or on my to-do list. And I bet tomorrow will be just the same. Whatever will I do then?</p>

                    <p>Heh, upon reading your comment I investigated further and discovered that I did in fact receive <strong>four</strong> e-mails today, if I just checked all my accounts. I guess I&#8217;m just on vacation already!</p>

<p>As for the photo, wow, you must have had some nice fast glass on, and a front-row seat too. Or do you really have a zoom that fast &#8212; or a flash that powerful?</p>
