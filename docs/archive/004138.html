				<p>The new <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/timeline" target="_blank">Facebook timeline</a>: it&#8217;s gorgeous, it&#8217;s interesting, it&#8217;sâ€¦ bound to fail. Why? Because it&#8217;s about Facebook listening <em>at</em> its users, not listening <em>to</em> them.</p><p>For a long time, Facebook has been barraged with requests for privacy controls. If you&#8217;ve ever been involved in product design, you&#8217;ve heard requests like these too: clear, concrete feature requests from users who know your product well and who are valuable customers for you. You must always ignore these reasonable, specific, actionable requests.</p><p>I call them &#8220;coffeepot toothbrush&#8221; requests, as in &#8220;please put a toothbrush charger on my coffeepot, so that I can do all of my morning stuff at once.&#8221; Seems reasonable, right? Except the user has misdiagnosed themselves: they think they&#8217;re trying to &#8220;do their morning stuff.&#8221; I&#8217;d say they&#8217;re trying to &#8220;get clean, so that they can be seen by other people&#8221; and also &#8220;get energy, so that they  can drive to work and then do work.&#8221; The <em>feelings</em> that are associated with &#8220;clean&#8221; and with &#8220;energy&#8221; are completely opposite here: fresh peppermint toothpaste, and then smoky, earthy, hot coffee: the one will ruin the other.</p><p>It&#8217;s not that the two needs are unrelated &#8212; they are related, and that&#8217;s why they&#8217;ve been conflated. They&#8217;re just necessarily separated, because of their context. Facebook has heard a lot about the need for privacy controls; it also has an internal vision of Facebook truly being someone&#8217;s data manifestation of their life. These appear related, but, again, have different contexts.</p><p>So Facebook has misdiagnosed the cause of user requests: users don&#8217;t want privacy controls &#8212; although it&#8217;s reasonable Facebook would try to supply them, since what Facebook can bring is controls. Users want privacy because the various people they know need <em>context</em>. Some people have context for what they see, some don&#8217;t; and context is a big, difficult thing to provide.</p><p>Context isn&#8217;t a category, it&#8217;s not a control, it&#8217;s not even privacy &#8212; it&#8217;s related information. If you keep seeing pictures of me drinking booze on Facebook, you might think: oh, he&#8217;s an alcoholic! Let&#8217;s not hire him. Or, if you spoke to me that week, you might know: oh, he went to a single-malt scotch tasting, because he occasionally enjoys one single glass of scotch in the evening! It&#8217;s hard to know, if you haven&#8217;t spoken to me lately.</p><p>Privacy controls are a simple, clear, specific, actionable replacement for context: with a privacy control, I can simply hide the photos of me at the tasting so that I don&#8217;t have to explain to you whether or not I&#8217;m a drunk who&#8217;ll pass out on my desk at work. That&#8217;s a lot easier than showing you a long history of me not drinking too much and enjoying a scotch now and then! Privacy controls are Facebook&#8217;s coffeepot toothbrush.</p><p>And, when you match that coffeepot toothbrush with your wider vision that you can manifest someone&#8217;s life in data, well, you confuse yourself with LinkedIn. And then you create the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/timeline" target="_blank">Facebook Timeline</a>.</p>
