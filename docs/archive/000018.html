				<p>So today I cleaned part of the kitchen. Part of a whole new plan I&#8217;ve developed for myself to designate tasks around the house that I need to be doing and schedule them into free time that I&#8217;m not using to mellow out.</p>

<p>Now, when i was growing up, I didn&#8217;t really learn how to clean. Since as long as I can remember, my parents had someone to help out with the cleaning &mdash; reasonable since they both worked full-time. For pretty much my entire youth, until junior high or something, our maid was Charlene. I always found her skills to by mysterious and magical; I wasn&#8217;t the neatest, cleanest kid and that she could keep things clean, and make the kitchen floor slippery, and god save us, keep the hardwood floors shiny &mdash; clear signs of mythical abilities. My puny powers, in contrast, only involved the ability to mow the lawn, wash dishes, and often weasel out of taking out the trash.</p>

<p>Of course, filth was acceptable in college. Then, when I graduated, I got a job where they expected me to bill 40 hours by the end of Wednesday, so I didn&#8217;t have time to clean; I got a maid. And, when I moved and got my second job, I got another maid. And then, due to a run of bad luck involving a Palm Pilot, a burnt-out porch light and Las Vegas, I lost that maid. And then I had to keep things clean myself.</p>

<p>For two years, it&#8217;s been catch as catch can. And, frankly, every bit of the apartment&#8217;s just a little dirtier, just a little dustier, just a little dingier. That doesn&#8217;t sit well with me, especially since I have an incredibly wonderful <em>and</em> incredibly neat-and-clean girlfriend. And, now that I&#8217;ve grown up, now that I&#8217;m living on my own, I&#8217;ve given myself chores. Weekly chores. This week: the kitchen. I organized my oils and vinegars, my spices and a cabinet; I cleaned every inch of the stove; and I even turned the toaster upside-down and shook out all the years of crumbs. Mmmm crumbs.</p>
