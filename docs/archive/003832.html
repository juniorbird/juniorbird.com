				<p><span class="caps">OK, </span>love letters to technology are fun, but the downside of any new thing is that it&#8217;s not entirely identical to old things. Here are four things that I&#8217;ve had on <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003831.html">past cell phones</a> that I really miss &#8212; or at least haven&#8217;t found &#8212; for my iPhone.</p>

<h3>Profile Change Based on Calendar</h3>

<p>Back in the old days of my Nokia 3650 running the Symbian Series 60 <span class="caps">OS,</span> I had a clever program that automatically changed my phone&#8217;s profile based on things on my calendar. Interrupt a meeting with a loud ringer? Never, since the phone automatically changed my profile to &#8220;silent&#8221; when it found the word &#8220;meeting&#8221; in the current calendar event. Clever!</p>

<h3>Canned Text Responses to Rejected Calls</h3>

<p>Virtually every phone lets you send a text to the caller when you reject their call, but, back when that was a brilliant idea, I had a program on my Treo that had canned responses that you could send too. &#8220;I&#8217;m in a meeting, please call right back if it&#8217;s so urgent that I need to break out&#8221; is too much to type when you&#8217;re supposed to be paying attention to someone else, but not much to select from a menu.</p>

<h3>Bright, Over-Saturated Photos</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s face it, with the exception of a few phones, cell phone cameras are at best decent. Thanks to autofocus, the iPhone can give you some pretty clear, crisp lines. But the best way to hide a flawed photo is to give the eye something else to look at! The 3650 took awful, fuzzy, color-shifted photos that were nonetheless oversaturated and high-contrast. And that made them fun to look at, even if they were tiny and low-resolution.</p>

<h3>App Categories</h3>

<p>The iPhone interface is actually very similar to the old Palm interface, except, rather than giving you just a few screens to keep programs on, the Palm let you assign categories to your applications and display one category at a time. The best part of this was how easy it was to match an app and a category. Selecting the Category menu item brought up a list of all of your apps, each with a category pop-up next to it. Select the desired category in the pop-up and you were done. You could categorize a single app in a second or re-categorize everything in just a minute or two. On the iPhone, shifting things around means dragging icon after icon past screen after screen &#8212; disorganization&#8217;s easier.</p>
