				<p>The Marshall Career Development Office has a program in which, every year, they match a small number of students with volunteer alumni mentors. About a month ago, on somwhat of a lark, I applied.</p>

<p>It was a lark because I didn&#8217;t really think I&#8217;d get it. There are a ton of qualified, ultra-competitive people in my class, and I figured they&#8217;d be right on the ball; there are also a number of really bright career-switchers who could use a push in the right direction. Between those two groups, what kind of a chance does a middle-of-the road, reasonably erudite, reasonably set-in-his-ways marketer stand?</p>

<p>Well, I&#8217;m always one for a fight, so I put my hat in the ring. Even wrote my first ever <a href="http://cleverbird.com/pwyky/CoverLetter">non-crappy cover letter</a> for it. And, apparently I got the mentor; out of over 90 applicants, I was one of just 19 selected.</p>

<p>So I now have a really talented alumni mentor, a smart guy who started his own communications business that finds really interesting and unique approaches to marketing. I&#8217;m very much looking forward to meeting him and learning new ways to approach the marketing industry. Maybe he can help me find a unique way to package me! At any rate, it&#8217;s great to have another opportunity to take everything that Marshall offers. Now, if only Marshall was better at offering a good night&#8217;s sleep!</p>
