				I used to do this thing? Where I <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000353.html" target="_blank">did</a> <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001004.html" target="_blank">my</a> <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002166.html" target="_blank">resolutions</a> <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003045.html" target="_blank">for</a> <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003615.html" target="_blank">the</a> <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003791.html" target="_blank">year</a>? It was awesome. Instead, this year, I <a href="http://tumblr.juniorbird.com/post/362327434/new-year-new-blog" target="_blank">re-launched my blog</a>. We won’t get into how silly it is that simply not having a blog I was happy with meant that I didn’t do resolutions, but, there we are.&#xA0;Hopefully, it’s not to late. So I’ll return to the format of years past; a review of last year’s resolutions, followed by this year’s. To wit:<h3>Last Year’s Resolutions</h3><ol>	<li>Go to more networking events, and go to them regularly, to meet more people.<em>This I did, and did well!</em></li>	<li>Go to at least two Marshall Tailgates, to see my friends from school.<em>Instead of paying attention to the football season, I got married. This killed Fantasy Football too. It was well worth it!</em></li>	<li>Continue to post twice weekly to WadeArmstrong.com.<em>Instead, I planned a wedding.</em></li>	<li>Post at least once a week here to Juniorbird.com, including regular, but not monthly, meal and drink recipes.<em>Instead, I planned a wedding.</em></li>	<li>Start a mystery book-writing club, and get far into writing a (blockbuster!) mystery.<em>Instead, I planned a wedding.</em></li>	<li>Get my orange belt in Krav Maga.<em>Instead, I planned a wedding. And got really into <a href="http://www.crossfit.com/" target="_blank">Crossfit</a>.</em></li>	<li>Travel at least once this year, probably out of the country.<em>Hey, here’s something on this list getting married <a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/Honeymoon" target="_blank">helped me do</a>.</em></li>	<li>Lose 20 lbs. — I started the year at 190, which is really about 20 lbs. over the weight I look best at. I will probably blog more about this!<em>Again, saved by the getting married thing! I ate well and exercised a ton all year, and got down to 170 pretty easily.</em></li>	<li>Get another tattoo.<em>Hey, getting married is starting to add up! I got a lovely tattoo of a crab to celebrate my engagement. My poor wife!</em></li>	<li>Get out and take photographs regularly, preferably a scheduled monthly shoot.<em>I did ok, but not great, here. More shooting this year, I hope!</em></li></ol><h3>This Year’s Resolutions</h3><span class="caps">OK, </span>one change here is that there will be no business-related resolutions here, including anything about “Toastmasters” or “Networking.” I spend enough time on business during business hours. With no further ado:<ol>	<li>Get another tattoo</li>	<li>Maintain my weight at about 170</li>	<li>Get a new perspective, photographically</li>	<li>Speaking of, shoot monthly</li>	<li>Go to at least one Marshall Tailgate</li>	<li>Blog all the time, including about booze and cooking</li>	<li>Be an awesome, supportive, husband</li>	<li>Get the family finances in great shape</li>	<li>Spend more time building friendships</li>	<li>Move my life forward in a way that makes sense for me and, especially, for my brand-new family!</li></ol>I think I can pull all these resolutions off this year, even with these two months gone before I got around to the resolving. After all, this year I’m neither planning a wedding nor going on a honeymoon!Not that I mean that as a good thing. But, oh, the spare time I’ll have.
