							<h3>Why is it That a Pet Almost Dies at Every Party I Hold?</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov  1, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_photos.html">Photos</a>, <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_will_somebody_please_explain_to_me.html">Will Somebody Please Explain To Me...</a></p>
						    	
							<p>So at the <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003702.html">Housewarming Party</a> the <a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/gallery/3054487_JzRG2/1/166319766_anwr9">dog</a> walked out the front door, took a left turn, and went absentmindedly exploring down the block. A neighbor a few houses down fortunately recognized him and came by carrying the little guy. Let me tell you that finding a black dog in the middle of the night did not sound like a good bet at the time and we were sure happy to see the pup. Then, as we were setting up for last night&#8217;s combined Halloween/AIG&#8217;s Birthday party, a <a href="http://identify.whatbird.com/obj/36/_/Coopers_Hawk.aspx">Cooper&#8217;s Hawk</a> suddenly swept down from the sky gunning straight for <a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/gallery/1437283_4rCYr/1/68344502_yTuCP">Junior</a>. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003745.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Hello Internet, Can You Tell Me Where the Dog Hid the Onion?</h3>

							<p>The dog was acting quite proud earlier today. Since he had recently barked at some people walking past the house, I thought nothing of it; but then I noticed the empty bag of onions on the floor next to him. The bag of onions that, last I checked it, held a rather sizeable red onion. And the dog, looking so proud, seated right next to the empty bag. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003708.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Why Isn't There a Place to Find Out About LAPD Chases in Real Time?</h3>
							<p class="date">Aug 29, 2007 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_will_somebody_please_explain_to_me.html">Will Somebody Please Explain To Me...</a></p>
						    	
							<p><span class="caps">OK, </span>let me lead this one off by clarifying. I often joke that I live in the ghetto; at the same time, I&#8217;ve never felt unsafe in my neighborhood. Everyone&#8217;s nice. That said, there&#8217;s either a high-speed chase going right by here or an <span class="caps">LAPD </span>chopper hovering over here once a month. And what do I ever hear about it? It&#8217;s not in the LA Times (they only have <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/homicidereport/">a blog to cover murders</a>, and even that&#8217;s a day behind), it&#8217;s not on <a href="http://cbs2.com/"><span class="caps">KCAL</span> 9</a>. But, gosh, it seems to be important enough at the moment, given the number of sirens I hear and what I imagine is the cost of keeping a chopper in the air. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003443.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Waiter, Where's My Fashion Plate?</h3>

							<p>Two years of school and two years of startup haven&#8217;t left me with a big clothing budget. I&#8217;d like to take what I own rather further than it&#8217;s going currently. But, as I contemplate radical things like not getting my dress shirts starched so that I can have one of these &#8220;casual&#8221; looks, I&#8217;m having trouble finding sources for good fashion ideas. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003372.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Will Somebody Please Explain to Me to Whom to Complain About My Health Insurance Premium</h3>
							<p class="date">Feb  1, 2007 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_will_somebody_please_explain_to_me.html">Will Somebody Please Explain To Me...</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I am Annoyed Consumer. The people at Blue Cross &#8212; normally I would say fine people, but not in this case &#8212; have raised my rates. Now, I&#8217;m aware that there&#8217;s this thing called &#8220;inflation&#8221; and this other thing called &#8220;progress&#8221; and that, sometimes, these conspire to make health insurance premiums go up. But somehow I don&#8217;t think that a 20% increase is representative of the core health care inflation rate. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003105.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Will Somebody Please Explain to Me What the SVN vs. CVS Thing Is?</h3>
							<p class="date">Sep 27, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_will_somebody_please_explain_to_me.html">Will Somebody Please Explain To Me...</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I discovered <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/"><span class="caps">CVS</span></a> at the very beginning of this century, when I was doing Web dev. Getting past revisions? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">Diff</a>? Little notes on what changes I&#8217;d made? Life-saver. Even after leaving the industry, I kept much of my work in <span class="caps">CVS, </span>because revisions and branching are useful even for binary file formats, such as Word .docs or Photoshop .psds. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002775.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Will Somebody Please Explain To Me What The Heck Is Up With Spam These Days?</h3>
							<p class="date">Apr 21, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_will_somebody_please_explain_to_me.html">Will Somebody Please Explain To Me...</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Was a time when the spam that flooded my mailbox was <strong>real</strong> spam, giving me the specifics on how to gain a few inches where it counts or lose weight or get <span class="caps">OEM </span>software or whatever. These days, I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on. To get around the filters, spammers put every letter on its own line or throw in meaningless filler words or use eye-munging obfuscation in the hopes that my spam filter won&#8217;t figure out that h00d1a is a common spam word but that I will grok that it is a weight-loss product.  <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002517.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Will Somebody Please Explain to Me Why They Put the Lane Markers the Long Way at the Pool?</h3>
							<p class="date">Apr 19, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_will_somebody_please_explain_to_me.html">Will Somebody Please Explain To Me...</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I like it when the pools are set up with 25-meter lengths. It&#8217;s easy to gut it through just one more length when they&#8217;re that short, and the 25-meater lengths give twice as many lanes as do the 50-meter length. Sure, with a circuit you can easily fit four people in a 50-meter lane, but, for us marginally-fit trying-to-get-in-shape swimmers, we&#8217;re not really consistent enough to kee pfrom running into each other, so it&#8217;s lane-splitting or bust. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002503.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
