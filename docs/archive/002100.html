				<p>Thank you for <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001818.php">upgrading my voice mail system</a>. I very much appreciate that you managed to replace a simple, effective old system with something that is new, annoying, and not nearly as well-suited to the usage patterns of any conceivable user of your services.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s actually difficult for me to decide where to start when considering how awful my new voicemail is, you&#8217;ve just given me so many different and distinct kinds of crappiness to consider. A few mis-features that particularly stand out are:</p>


<ul>
<li>Your persistence in announcing the number of the caller before I listen to their voicemail. This is potentially useful in, say, a large company&#8217;s voicemail system, because then I can hear &#8220;new message from Joe Argleburtz, in Materials Engineering&#8221; &#8212; that&#8217;s useful. But, statistically, most calls to me will be coming from outside of the Cingular network, so, instead, I&#8217;ll just get the phone number. Now, it might be fine if you announced the phone number in a chunked way &#8212; 310 555 1212, you know? That&#8217;s how people think of phone numbers and have tough of phone numbers since mine changed from <a href="http://www.laalmanac.com/communications/cm01e.htm">CLeveland 9-5777</a> . Instead, your computer reads a number off as 3105551212, which makes it essentially incomprehensible. It does, however, take up time before I get to the message, and both I and the person who called me would like to get to the message as soon as possible.</li>
<li>Once I do get to that message, my controls don&#8217;t include &#8220;delete&#8221; or &#8220;save&#8221;; I need to listen to the entire message before I can do anything to it. I can apparently hit the 3 key repeatedly to skip through the message but this strikes me as a lot of work, when, in most cases, I want to listen to the important beginning of the message and call back (or ignore the caller).</li>
<li>I suppose it is possible that there is some button that will delete messages while they&#8217;re playing, or skip straight to the end, or even a way that I can turn off the phone number announcement. However, there are <a href="http://www.cingular.com/customer_service/common_voice_mail#guide">two downloadable guides</a> for the system, based on what geographical area you&#8217;re in; neither covers California, however, which strikes me as a bit of an oversight.</li>
<li>The current system only keeps messages 14 days. Which is fine, actually; the old system didn&#8217;t keep messages very long either (although I think it may have kept them for 30 days). However, the old system played new messages first, followed by old messages; this one plays old messages first, followed by new messages, when I call in. This strikes me as a rather brain-dead choice, as I&#8217;ve already heard that old message and had 14 days in which to do something with it, while the new message is of unknown urgency and could be important. Also, it&#8217;s super-annoying since it&#8217;s hard to skip messages.</li>
<li>Password-free access. If I call voicemail from my phone, I get straight into my voicemail. This seems like a substantial security risk, should my phone be lost or stolen. I&#8217;ve had a Cingular phone since 1998 and I never noticed that keying in my password was a hassle.</li>
</ul>



<p>All that said, I do appreciate the system that allows me to check my voicemail from another phone, and I really appreciate that you gave me complete Bluetooth 1.2 on my phone, including full <span class="caps">OBEX.</span> Thanks, Cingular!</p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>Wade </p>

                    <p>I&#8217;ve always been shocked by the contract thing. It seems to me that there are three possible outcomes that a cell phone company will get if they don&#8217;t require contracts:</p>


<ol>
<li>The customer will be satisfied and stay with them. Revenue = lifetime value of customer (L)</li>
<li>The customer will be dissatisfied and leave them, but may come back later because there&#8217;s no bad blood and, hey, cell phone service is a commodity anyway. Revenue = some discount of lifetime value of customer to account for the years of sales you&#8217;ll lose (X*L, X &lt; 1)</li>
<li>The customer will be disatisfied and leave with a grudge. Revenue = 0</li>
</ol>



<p>Say all outcomes are equally likely (customer service should make outcome 1 the most likely of all but let&#8217;s ignore that for a moment). Then you have a total estimated value of 1/3L + 1/3X*L + 1/3$0.</p>

<p>Now suppose they&#8217;ve got you mad about escaping your contract; we can assume that you&#8217;ll never come back again. Then you&#8217;ve got 3 new outcomes:</p>


<ol>
<li>The customer will be satisfied and stay with them. Revenue = lifetime value of customer (L)</li>
<li>The customer will be dissatisfied but will stay for the contract, then leave forever. Revenue = remaining value of contract &#174;</li>
<li>The customer will be disatisfied and leave with a grudge. Revenue = buyout value of contract (B)</li>
</ol>



<p>If we again suppose that all three outcomes are equal, we have possible value of 1/3L + 1/3R + 1/3B.</p>

<p>So, this is a sound business decision if 1/3R + 1/3B &gt; 1/3X*L from the previous example. For young customers like ourselves, who are likely to eventually buy fancy phones and data services, and also likely to replace our land line with a mobile line, I&#8217;m not sure I buy this calculus.</p>
