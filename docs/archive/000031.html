				<p>Up until recently, I was getting physical therapy for <a href="http://my.webmd.com/content/article/17/1676_51627.htm">shin splints</a> and for <a href="http://my.webmd.com/content/healthwise/125/31037.htm">plantar fasciitis</a>. The treatments went well, the shin splints are almost gone and the pain from the plantar fasciitis is greatly reduced. I&#8217;m almost ready to start running 2-4 miles/day again!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got my physical therapy at <a href="http://www.kerlanjobe.com/">Kerlan-Jobe</a> in Westchester, near <span class="caps">LAX. </span> They have a competent and knowledgable (if somewhat overworked) staff, and great bedside manner.</p>

<p>The facility is pretty dee-luxe, what with all the fancy equipment:<br />
<img src="/images/kerlanjobe/allthemachines.jpg" alt="various nautilus-type machines" />
And even a pool! Some days I wish i could be in that pool. But the only people who get to be there are so badly injured they need the support of water to be able to move.<br />
<img src="/images/kerlanjobe/pool.jpg" alt="I could use a day at a warm-looking pool like this" /></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t get to use much of that, though, mostly they set me down on a treatment table and commit various unspeakable acts upon my person:<br />
<img src="/images/kerlanjobe/treatmenttable.jpg" alt="torture table" /></p>

<p>Tools of my mistreatment include:<br />
<img src="/images/kerlanjobe/therope.jpg" alt="a fiendish length of knotted rope" /><img src="/images/kerlanjobe/rollingthingy.jpg" alt="a sinister metal tube" /><img src="/images/kerlanjobe/wedges.jpg" alt="wedges to step on" /></p>

<p>Yes, with these fiendish implements, they make me carry out all sorts of sinister shiftings, stirrings and agitations, all with the stated goal of fixing my infirmities. Sometimes I suspect that some exercises are just designed to amuse the therapists &mdash;  although, in all honesty, this round of physical therapy is much easier than what I had to go through for my badly sprained ankle last year. Most of these evolutions are designed to increase the flexibility of my lower legs. It&#8217;s a sad story, really, because running actually makes you <em>less</em> flexible, so I&#8217;m pretty tight from the thigh down. If ya know what I mean.</p>

<p>I use that rope to try to pull my leg towards me and stretch my hamstring. Frankly, with as small a stretch as I get, I can hardly believe that I can walk:<br />
<img src="/images/kerlanjobe/ropeexercise.jpg" alt="pull baby pull stretch that hamstring out" /></p>


<p>Much more fun is rolling the metal tube with my foot. It&#8217;s like a little foot massage! Breaks up the scarring and swelling in my arch.<br />
<img src="/images/kerlanjobe/rollingtheroller.jpg" alt="roll the metal tube back and forth and back and forth and back and forth" /></p>

<p>Of course, my favorite part is the <em>real</em> massage:<br />
<img src="/images/kerlanjobe/massage.jpg" alt="a pretty girl rubs my foot" /></p>

<p>Then I get to run on this extra-deluxe treadmill. Apparently, it cost $100,000! And it feels like it too &mdash; as good as the springiest, softest track I&#8217;ve ever been on.<br />

The treadmill<br />
<img src="/images/kerlanjobe/rubbertrack.jpg" alt="rubber feels good on my feet, not on my boy thingy" />
Look how comfy that track looks!<br />
<img src="/images/kerlanjobe/controlpanel.jpg" alt="so many buttons!" />
And all these controls!</p>


<p>But after the run comes the ice!<br />
<img src="/images/kerlanjobe/iced.jpg" alt="Cold on my foot and shins" />
Some people love ice, some people hate it. I hate it for the first couple of minutes, then I tolerate it &#8216;cause it makes me feel better &mdash; but I don&#8217;t get the soothing feeling that others get. It could be worse, though, last time I got physical therapy I had &#8220;The Bucket&#8221;<br />
<img src="/images/kerlanjobe/thebucket.jpg" alt="a trash can filled with ice" />
A trash can filled with ice &mdash; ouchie!</p>

<p>Well, supposedly I&#8217;m cured, and I&#8217;ll have the appointment to prove that to the doc tomorrow. Updates as events warrant.</p>
