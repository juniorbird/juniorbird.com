				<p>Was a time when the spam that flooded my mailbox was <strong>real</strong> spam, giving me the specifics on how to gain a few inches where it counts or lose weight or get <span class="caps">OEM </span>software or whatever. These days, I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on. To get around the filters, spammers put every letter on its own line or throw in meaningless filler words or use eye-munging obfuscation in the hopes that my spam filter won&#8217;t figure out that h00d1a is a common spam word but that I will grok that it is a weight-loss product. </p>

<p>And lately it seems like the spam has become so content-heavy, in order to get around the filters, that the actual content is drowning out the spam! Like the latest, a fine effort from a company that put nothing but a single link to some advertised content and the following fine joke:</p>

<blockquote><p>A rich white man threw a party and invited all of his buddies and neighbors, including Leroy, the only black guy in the neighborhood. He held the party around the pool in the backyard of his mansion. Everyone was having a good time drinking, dancing, eating <span class="caps">BBQ </span>and flirting with the women. At the height of the party, the host said, &#8220;I came home from a business trip and I found a 10 foot alligator got in my pool and I can&#8217;t find anybody who will come and take him away. I&#8217;d give a million dollars to anyone who would do the job!&#8221; The words were barely out of his mouth when there was a loud splash and everyone turned around and saw Leroy in the pool! Leroy was fighting the gator and kicking its ass! He was jabbing it in the eyes with his thumbs, throwing punches, head butts and chokeholds, biting the gator on the tail and flipping it through the air like some kind of Kung-Fu master. The water was churning and splashing in the struggle. Finally Leroy strangled the gator and let it float to the surface. He slowly climbed out of the pool. Everybody was staring in disbelief. Finally the host says, &#8220;Leroy, I reckon I owe you a million dollars.&#8221; &#8220;I don&#8217;t want it,&#8221; said Leroy, panting. The rich man said, &#8220;Leroy, I have to give you something! You won the bet.&#8221; Leroy said, &#8220;I would be satisfied if you gave me the name of whichever one of these white motherf**kers it was that pushed me in the pool.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>I mean, how does that get me to click through to a bukkake site?</p>
