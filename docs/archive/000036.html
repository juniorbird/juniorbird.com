				<p>It&#8217;s a beautiful sunny afternoon and I&#8217;m walking through a public park. On one side of me is a golf course; on both sides, the grass is green in that way it only gets on the east coast when it&#8217;s summer and the light is diffracted by the humidity. But it&#8217;s not hot and humid, it&#8217;s pleasant. I&#8217;m walking along a two-lane paved road passing through the park, I&#8217;m wearing my comfy hiking boots and I&#8217;m happily tooling down one hill and up the next, for it is a rather hilly park. I&#8217;m waiting for my parents to come along and pick me up.</p>

<p>Soon they drive by, in the maroon &#8216;92 Ford Taurus that was once theirs and is now mine. I get in the back seat, on the passenger&#8217;s side; the back seat on the driver&#8217;s side is filled with boxes. I ask them if they&#8217;ve picked up my girlfriend (my current one); they say they did, they took her for a while, but now it&#8217;s my turn to ride. I say, no way, let&#8217;s get my girlfriend, we can fit her in the center seat in the back. She shouldn&#8217;t have to walk!</p>

<p>So we turn around and drive back to get my girlfriend. On the way there, my father comments, &#8220;It&#8217;s lovely out here, you&#8217;d have a lovely place if you just cleaned up out front!&#8221; I flash on the place I live, seeing a tangle of gray brush through a sunny window looking out from the entrance foyer. The house I rent is a simple place from the &#8217;70s, somewhere in West Virginia.</p>

<p>About a one minute drive behind me, there&#8217;s my girlfriend, walking up a big, grassy hill. We meet her at the top, she&#8217;s wearing a black turtleneck and a plaid skirt, with brown boots. She looks lovely! I ask her, do you want to squeeze yourself in the middle, or should we walk to my parents&#8217; place together, it&#8217;ll only take a couple hours, but it&#8217;s only a five minute drive there.</p>

<p>As I begin to wake up from the dream, I realize it would&#8217;ve been most efficient if my parents took one of us at a time, since it only was a five minute drive.</p>
