				<p>Today was fascinating, not least because it was twenty-eight hours long and also included all of tomorrow. For a day that was almost entirely spent on an airplane, I got a fair dose of excitement.</p>

<p>It began, really, when I arrived three hours early for my flight to Bangkok, via Taipei. The first step was to shepherd my bag through security, a shockingly boring two-hour task, followed by a well-run 15-minute check-in at the China Airlines desk, followed, in turn, by a 30-minute wait in a line for security that stretched the length of <span class="caps">LAX&#8217;</span>s international terminal. Why, if one weren&#8217;t paying attention one might have thought that the Taiwanese were the organized, efficient first-world nation, while we were the inefficient, bureaucratic developing nation.</p>

<p>Any thoughts otherwise were, certainly, relieved when the <a href="http://cbs2.com/topstories/local_story_165215312.html">terminal was evacuated</a>. Nobody told us nothing, and none of the <span class="caps">TSA </span>cops followed-up that we were leaving the building; somehow, however, the momentum of the mass of humanity got moving outside, and, with some help from the <span class="caps">LAPD, </span>we were herded down to the next terminal.</p>

<p><img src="/images/SEAsia01/evacuation.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Actually, the evacuation was probably good for me, because I sprinted back in and got to security before the line managed to grow much more than a half dozen people long. Then I sprinted the length of the terminal to get to my gate; then I waited because they had to delay the plane for an hour to get it fully-fueled. Oh well, that&#8217;s better than flying an incompletely-fueled plane.</p>

<p>Once in the air, I fell asleep fast (recall my original 1:15am departure), but was rudely awoken in mid-Pacific by 40 minutes of medium-grade turbulence. Ten minutes were fun, fifteen was still kind of cool, but by 25 I was getting a little bit of motion sickness and I was glad to leave the bumpy air behind and get back to sleep. Morning brought a very Chinese airplane meal of pork congee and pickles.</p>

<p>The next step was a seven-hour wait in Taiwan&#8217;s Chiang Kai Shek airport, which was universally referred to there as <span class="caps">CKS </span>airport &#8212; I wonder if that&#8217;s a political statement? Anyway, I could tell I&#8217;d gotten to my gate early:</p>

<p><img src="/images/SEAsia01/taipei.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>So I took the time to look at all of the signage, quite the challenge since I neither speak nor read any Asian language. Fortunately, at least one of the following signs doesn&#8217;t need any translation:</p>

<p><img src="/images/SEAsia01/birds.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/SEAsia01/ducks.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I think the second sign says, top to bottom:</p>


<ul>
<li>Waterfowl will be imported into <span class="caps">TRON</span></li>
<li>No right-facing ducks, left-facing ducks and pigs only</li>
<li>For that matter, no right front wheels</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t forget to call your duck when traveling</li>
<li>Dynamite is fun!</li>
</ul>



<p>I had a nice bowl of beef and noodles at the airport, then, finally, got to sleep all the way to Thailand (I noticed that my flight&#8217;s map studiousy avoided any overflight of China. Then I landed in Bangkok, welcomed by a sudden thunderstorm that lit the sky with flashes. I made it past crowds of hucksters, keeping on the straight-and-narrow until I went to a stand that said &#8220;taxi&#8221; and procured a transport there which was not, in fact, a taxi, being rather about twice as expensive for the same service. After that I got to see my hotel room:</p>

<p><img src="/images/SEAsia01/room.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>And its scenic view</p>

<p><img src="/images/SEAsia01/outwindow.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Well, all that&#8217;s not bad, since I&#8217;ll be heading out tomorrow to see the real Bangkok and not the real Khao San road (yes, I&#8217;m in the backpacker&#8217;s haven &#8212; thought it would be easier to find a drink out if I wanted one). I had a quick dinner at a streetside stand today, and tomorrow we&#8217;ll really test if I can survive more of that. For now, I plan to collapse in complete exhaustion, since two days is a lot to fit into one!</p>

                    <p>It hurts to laugh.  But I laughed anyway at your interpretation of the sign.  Don&#8217;t forget to call your duck when traveling!  I look forward to more updates.  Have a wonderful, safe trip!  I miss you already!</p>

                    <p>Okay, I signed up JUST so I could comment on how hard I laughed at your sign interpretations&#8230;I laughed so hard, I actually shed a few tears.  brilliant.</p>


<p>The sick chicken/duck sign is indescribably magical.  If they sell posters of that at the airport, I&#8217;d like two, please.  :)</p>
