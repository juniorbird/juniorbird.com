				<p>When I was in junior high, we got a little vacation place in West Virginia, near <a target="_blank" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=hedgesville,+wv&amp;sll=37.913997,-81.535666&amp;sspn=0.593723,0.8638&amp;g=montcoal,+wv&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Hedgesville,+Berkeley,+West+Virginia&amp;ll=39.567588,-77.908173&amp;spn=0.290066,0.4319&amp;z=11">Hedgesville</a>. We&#8217;d go on three-day weekends, sometimes on regular weekends, if my parents needed a break. There was nothing out there but rolling hills, country diners, and tall, thin, dense pine trees over gray ground. And quiet. The next cabin over must&#8217;ve been only 150 feet away but you couldn&#8217;t even see it or hear it through those trees. If you looked sharp you could see the deer go through the gully: spot the white salt lick first, then the dun deer, then the fawns behind it.</p><p>It says something about the economy of West Virginia that a pretty reasonably middle-class family from Baltimore could afford a vacation place there &#8212; the only response I&#8217;ve ever gotten to revealing my hometown out there is &#8220;wow, that&#8217;s a rough place.&#8221; (<em>And &#8220;is that your accent or are you mentally handicapped &#8212; ed.</em>) So I couldÂ  understand how somebody working there would go down into a coal mine.</p><p>And coal mining really does permeate the state. Our backyard held the c-shaped trace of an old open pit mine, and every hike brought you past another half-dozen. Maybe it&#8217;s hard to understand for Westerners: mining out here means a scenic tunnel entrance in the side of a rugged hill; mining in West Virginia seems more often to mean a pit in the ground or, these days, the top of a mountain chopped clean off. I never saw one of those except from an airplane. All for coal for us and money for them.</p>
