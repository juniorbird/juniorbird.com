							<h3>Free Michael!</h3>
							<p class="date">Mar 26, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_otherwise_uncategorized.html">Otherwise Uncategorized</a></p>
						    	
							<p><span class="caps">OK, </span>it looks like <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/03/25/jackson.trial/">Michael Jackson is going down</a>. But it&#8217;s not his fault. It&#8217;s all of ours. Free Michael! He doesn&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s doing, we all made him coo-coo. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001381.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Restore Terry Schiavo's Rights!</h3>
							<p class="date">Mar 21, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_ye_olde_politicks.html">Ye Olde Politicks</a></p>
						    	
							<p>The case of Terry Schiavo, currently <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/LAW/03/21/schiavo/index.html">playing itself out in the Federal courts</a>, is a sad one. I can understand the positions of both Terry&#8217;s husband &#8212; that her feeding tube should be removed &#8212; and of her parents &#8212; that Terry&#8217;s life should be prolonged. What I can&#8217;t understand is Congress&#8217;s need to involve themselves in this case. The involvement of the Federal and Florida Legislatures is a simple violation of both Terry and Michael&#8217;s rights, and a frightening violation of the seperation of powers enshrined in our Constitution. Per the decision of several courts, Terry should have her feeding tube immediately removed. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001363.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>There's Changes Being Made</h3>

							<p>You may have noticed the changes made to this site: the ads and the (return of the) links box on the right. Nothing like blowing a little vacation on the blog! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001357.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Foremanized</h3>

							<p>Like most foodies, I&#8217;ve been dismissive of the George Foreman Grill. But, earlier this week, my Wonderful Girlfriend cured me of that. Boy does that grill make a good sandwich. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001231.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>So Bush followed up his appointment of a prominent anti-UN pundit to the position of UN Ambassador with the appointment of a divisive individual to be the head of a bank with the word &#8220;World&#8221; in it. What in the world is going on? <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001225.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>ApplyYourself Hack: What Should Be Done?</h3>
							<p class="date">Mar 10, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a></p>
						    	
							<p>If you applied to b-school, you probably had the <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/000539.html">fairly mediocre experience</a> of using <a href="http://applyyourself.com/">ApplyYourself</a>, a service that allows you to apply, and track the status of your applications, in the most inefficient way possible. This year, some smart boys figured out how to get their admit decisions weeks early by <a href="http://poweryogi.blogspot.com/2005/03/hbsapplyyourself-admit-status-snafu.html">exploiting a security hole</a> in ApplyYourself. Harvard has <a href="http://www.reuters.com/printerFriendlyPopup.jhtml?type=oddlyEnoughNews&amp;storyID=7841543">decided to reject</a> everyone it thinks took advantage of this hole. I&#8217;m not sure that&#8217;s right; there&#8217;s more nuance here than meets the eye. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001206.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>I Can't Get No Satisficetion</h3>

							<p>My teammates this term are great, but one half of my team has a profound difference with the other half &#8212; hopefully, it shan&#8217;t be irreconcilable. See, half of my team is made of perfectionists; the other half, including me, is made of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing">satisficers</a>. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001195.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Thank Goodness For The Third World!</h3>
							<p class="date">Mar  6, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_food.html">Food</a></p>
						    	
							<p>One of the many injustices and trials heaped upon little ol&#8217; me in this life is that I&#8217;m <a href="http://allergies.about.com/cs/corn/a/aa053199.htm">allergic to corn</a>. I actually figured this out a few years ago after spending a couple of years being sick and miserable all the time! But removing corn from my diet has been difficult, it&#8217;s in <em>everything</em>. I cook a lot of my own food, and eat a lot of organic stuff, but who wants to eat crunchy-granola additive-free foods all the time? That&#8217;s why I thank goodness for corn-free foods imported from third-world countries. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001202.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Syria And Me</h3>
							<p class="date">Mar  4, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_otherwise_uncategorized.html">Otherwise Uncategorized</a></p>
						    	
							<p>After years of letting Syria treat Lebanon as a virutal province, our President is finally <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/ALLPOLITICS/03/04/us.syria.ap/index.html">suggesting that they leave</a>. It&#8217;s about time! If Clinton had just done the same thing, I wouldn&#8217;t have almost gotten married back in college. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001196.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Always Listen To The Marketers</h3>
							<p class="date">Mar  3, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_bidness.html">Bidness</a></p>
						    	
							<p>My Management Accounting Prof once told us this great story about how <span class="caps">TWA </span>went out of business because they didn&#8217;t listen to the Marketers. It may be a bunch of baloney, but when I hear the Accounting people say &#8220;up with Marketing!&#8221; then I figure it&#8217;s time to listen. Also, it&#8217;s funny. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001192.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>My Landlord: Swinging '70s Bachelor</h3>
							<p class="date">Mar  1, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_otherwise_uncategorized.html">Otherwise Uncategorized</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Until today, I&#8217;d not had much contact with my landlord. But, after our recent rains, he dropped by to check out the damage (old house + old roof = many leaks). As I showed him the stains and the cracking and peeling, he asked me what I was studying. I told him I was in business school, and he told me to watch out for the women, they&#8217;re in charge today. But, back in the &#8217;70s, it turns out, he was in charge. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001185.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
