							<h3>GMAT, Episode 3: Movin' On Up</h3>
							<p class="date">Sep 30, 2003 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a></p>
						    	
							<p>After a solid week of practice, I&#8217;ve moved from getting the medium-level questions on my practice <span class="caps">GMAT </span>to getting hard questions. This is good, because the harder the questions you get (at least on the computer-adaptive test), the higher the score you&#8217;re eligible to get. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000234.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>GMAT, Episode 2: Attack Of The Math Creatures</h3>
							<p class="date">Sep 25, 2003 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a></p>
						    	
							<p>When I was preparing to take the <span class="caps">SAT, </span>one of the most important things I learned from my Princeton Review prep book was how to spot the trick questions and answers in that test. My Princeton Review <span class="caps">GMAT </span>prep book is doing the same thing, and I think it will be very helpful. With many of the wrong answers in the test designed to look &#8220;right&#8221;, it&#8217;s important to know how to spot these answers and stay away from them. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000232.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p class="date">Sep 24, 2003 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a></p>
						    	
							<p>For many years, I imagined that my next test would be the <span class="caps">GRE, </span>either in Poli Sci or Psychology, depending on whether I wanted to be a spook for the <span class="caps">CIA </span>or an industrial psychologist modeling workplace behavior. Well, it turns out I&#8217;m taking the <span class="caps">GMAT </span>instead. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000230.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>After leaving my Web design firm, I took a few months to really think about what I wanted to do next. Going to business school quite has filtered itself to the top of my list, and I&#8217;m very excited about the prospect. But the fact is, I&#8217;m behind. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000229.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Who am I? I&#8217;m a 28-year-old boy from Baltimore living in Los Angeles and planning to go to business school in the fall of 2004 (when, incidentally, I will be 29). I&#8217;m interested in the Web and cooking and several other topics which don&#8217;t make nearly such interesting subjects for a blog. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000228.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Me and the Wonderful Girlfriend went to Ojai, just north of Los Angeles, for a relaxing weekend getaway. It was exactly what we were looking for! We had great treatments&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000218.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>After much trepidation, I upgraded to OS X a little more than three months ago.
