				<p>Mel Gibson&#8217;s &#8220;The Passion&#8221; is  opening well, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/Movies/02/25/passion.wrap/index.html">according to <span class="caps">CNN</span></a>. This is a movie that, a year ago, was dismissed as a bizarre self-indulgence by a man who had possibly gone over the deep end. Gibson was said to be pouring his own money into a film that nobody would ever see. Yet today we hear about &#8220;The Passion&#8221; on every TV news show. This little film became big because of one thing: publicity. Negative publicity, sure, but this is Hollywood, where they&#8217;ve long held no publicity is bad publicity. Protesters forgot this axiom, and have hyped Gibson&#8217;s pet project more than he ever could have.</p>
				
				<p>When you come out against something, you&#8217;re engaging in marketing &#8212; selling what you have to say. As in every marketing campaign, you need a clear message and clear goals.</p>

<p>But protest is a unique kind of marketing, because it&#8217;s not only your position you must sell &#8212; it&#8217;s your position over theirs. So in every mention of your position you must talk about that to which it is in opposition. You give your enemies free publicity. So it&#8217;s important to make sure that you push your message more, and more effectively, than your opponent&#8217;s. And there&#8217;s the part that people forget: if your opponent is not getting their message out there, by protesting you&#8217;re giving them free publicity.</p>

<p>By protesting &#8220;The Passion&#8221; so long before it opened, Jewish activist groups raised the project&#8217;s profile and helped many to know about a film they may never have been exposed to. As an ethnic Jew, I feel it&#8217;s very important to stand up against anti-Semitism. But, as with all causes, it&#8217;s important to pick battles.</p>

<p>When picking a battle to fight, one must consider what can be won. What could be won here? What, simply, were the marketing goals?</p>


<ul>
<li>To prevent &#8220;The Passion&#8221; from being made or released? Gibson was financing the whole thing himself and had the money to make both happen. <em>Burying &#8220;The Passion&#8221; was an unrealistic and unachievable goal.</em></li>
<li>To damage Gibson&#8217;s career? A better method then would have been a quiet buzz campaign in Hollywood itself, concentrating on changing the opinions of key actors. <em>Making producers, directors, actors, etc. make a public choice for or against Gibson was less likely to succeed in this town&#8217;s collegial atmosphere than a more quiet informal blacklisting.</em></li>
<li>To prevent the movie from succeeding commercially? This was never about money for Gibson, so he never planned a big movie. Gibson pitched the film at a (mostly Evangelical) Christian audience, so, to succeed, a boycott had to keep Christians away while not attracting those outside Gibson&#8217;s target market. The key influencer for Evangelicals is not the media but their pastors. <em>To sink the film in the box office, quiet discussion with pastors and groups of pastors about the issues of anti-Semitism and about Gibson&#8217;s fringe Catholicism would have been the only way to go.</em></li>
<li>To create a dialogue about anti-Semitism? Well, frankly, judging a film based upon what can easily be spun as &#8220;just the Gospels&#8221; as anti-Semitic before seeing it isn&#8217;t much of a dialogue-starter. <em>To start a dialogue, start a dialogue, don&#8217;t protest, yell, etc. Dialogues are two-way and respectful.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>No possible objective was achievable through protest. None. So why protest? Why create a big loud noise about a movie with no buzz, months before the movie was released? Somebody get these folks a marketing consultant. </p>
