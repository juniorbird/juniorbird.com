				<p>I interviewed at <span class="caps">USC </span>on Wednesday. I&#8217;ve thought the experience over several since then, and I feel the same every time: I think the interview went well and that the interviewer helped make me more excited about the school.</p>

<p>And getting an e-mail the very next day from <span class="caps">NYU </span>asking me to interview didn&#8217;t hurt my sunshiney attitude at all. </p>
				
				<p>The Marshall interview ended up being a nice conversation about me and about business school. For about an hour, we talked about where I&#8217;d worked and studied, what I wanted from business school, and what <span class="caps">USC </span>could offer. All in all, the Marshall interview went better than the Kenan-Flagler interview. I&#8217;m still excited about <span class="caps">UNC, </span>but I think there were a couple of differences between the two experiences that made the later interview the better.</p>

<p>The first difference was switching to an in-person interview from a phone interview. I was able to personally connect with the interviewer sitting face-to-face with him, an opportunity that wasn&#8217;t available over the phone.</p>

<p>The second difference was that this was not my first interview. I&#8217;d read about what happens in interviews, but there&#8217;s a difference between reading and doing. With experience, I was able to better use the information I&#8217;d prepared for my applications in conversation. During various parts of the conversation, I was able to pull in anecdotes and strengths I&#8217;d mentioned in my essays for Marshall and for other schools; in fact, the interviewer only asked me three or four questions during the whole process; I was able to answer all of his other questions before he asked them.</p>

<p>In the future, I&#8217;ll make sure I interview face-to-face; that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m now trying to figure out when I can make it to New York. It&#8217;ll be a fun trip!</p>
