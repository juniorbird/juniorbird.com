				<p>Well, at least I picked the winner.</p>

<p>I honestly didn&#8217;t expect as many touchdowns; 26-20 only works with <strong>lots</strong> of field goals. I also didn&#8217;t expect New England to successfully run the ball, or the Panthers to be able to throw long passes. This is probably why I&#8217;m not an <span class="caps">NFL </span>coach.</p>

<p>While it was nice that Tom Brady got another <span class="caps">MVP </span>award, the true <span class="caps">MVP</span>s were the Pats offensive linemen. For the QB to get out unsacked and Faulk and Smith to be able to run the ball at all, well, that was quite a feat. Sadly, linemen will never get recognition like that; I couldn&#8217;t even vote for the o-line on http://superbowl.com.</p>

<p>It was a pretty good game, all in all, and I enjoyed watching it. Especially &#8212; unlike everybody else &#8212; the first 20 minutes and the defensive clinic put on by both teams. I could have watched another 40 minutes of that.</p>

<p>I was surprised by the simplicity of the Patriots&#8217; defense; they didn&#8217;t run any of their exotic blitzes (and the blitzes they ran didn&#8217;t work). I was also surprised by the simplicity of the Patriots&#8217; offense, which was missing lots of the slants and screens. After beating the Rams in the Super Bowl two years ago, Belichick made his entire system more complicated, mimicking the difficult-to-beat methods of Martz; after winning this year using simpler methods, like the Panthers&#8217;, will Belichick make things simpler next year?</p>
