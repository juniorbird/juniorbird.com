				<p>Like many Americans, I suffer from repetitive stress injuries, and it is only because of these that I&#8217;m not today a professional football coach or, with my stature, safety. However, also like many Americans, I certainly know as much about football as any coach or safety (although perhaps not as much as an offensive lineman), and therefore I plan to hold forth on exactly whom I pick to win tomorrow&#8217;s big game.</p>

<p>Were you to prick me, I would bleed either blue and orange or purple and black, depending, I guess, on where exactly you jab your sharp item into my skin (outside a nightclub in Atlanta, I&#8217;m quite confident that I would bleed purple and black). I divide my football allegiance between the Denver Broncos, who served as a replacement home team for me after I discovered football while in Colorado and then my hometown Colts committed perhaps the most odious, traitorous act in all of recorded history and moved to Indianapolis; and the Baltimore Ravens, who unexpectedly popped up in my hometown about fifteen years later. How can I pick between two home teams? No, I love them both. Sadly, this year neither is in the big game, the Ravens having tanked it from early on and the Broncos having suffered a spectacular, QB-led meltdown that caused me to lay in the middle of the floor, whimpering, for a good 30 minutes after the game.</p>

<p>So who should I root for? The Steelers, who dismantled my Broncs? The Seahawks, from the oh-so-strange <span class="caps">NFC, </span>but who didn&#8217;t victimize my favorites on their way to the top? It&#8217;s a hard decision, but, after a lot of thought, I&#8217;ve made a decision. I&#8217;m pulling for the Steelers.</p>

<p>A big part of it is just the play style of the team. It is my avowed desire to some day own an <span class="caps">NFL </span>team (note to self: must become much richer), and, when I own a team, it will be a three-yards-and-a-cloud-of-dust, fearsome-defense type of team. I don&#8217;t believe in that newfangled forward pass, and I definitely don&#8217;t believe in having your entire uniform be one color. The team that matches that description is, of course, the Steelers. Those Seahawks, with their ladylike passing offense, are a hollow mockery of what a football team should be. Well, except for Joe Jurivicius, who brought me a good number of points in fantasy ball this year. Thanks, Joe.</p>

<p>And it helps that the Steelers are from a big, old, Eastern, urban, blue-collar, heavy-industry town, just like my hometown Baltimore. How can I not like a team from a place like that? (Although, if Messrs. Mason and Dixon just hadn&#8217;t drawn <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason-Dixon_Line">their line</a> too far south, Philly would be in Maryland, and then it&#8217;d be obvious who I&#8217;d root for.)</p>

<p>Plus, I think the steelers will win. Two rushing TDs for Jerome Bettis, one passing for Smilin&#8217; Hines Ward, one passing for Heath Miller, and a field goal will make up their winning score of 31. Meanwhile, the patient running style of the Seahawks&#8217; Shaun Alexander will be rewarded with a lot of tackles for a loss by the ultra-fast Pittsburgh linebacker corps, and the two touchdowns and three field goals produced by their limp-wristed passing &#8220;offense&#8221; will leave Seattle with a measly 23 points at the end of the day. </p>

<p>So that&#8217;s it. Tune in tomorrow to see me proven horribly, tragically wrong. Go Steelers!</p>

                    <p>It would be hard for me to imagine a matchup with less interest for me, but here&#8217;s my one take&#8230;  When both teams won their conference championship games, the SB was being billed as 2 relative equal cinderellas.  But over the past 2 weeks, the press (and sentiment) has been increasingly focused on Pittsburgh.  I think all the fawning over Joey Porter and Troy Polamalu is going to provide tremendous motivation for Lofa Tatupu and, especially, Shaun Alexander who <strong>still</strong> isn&#8217;t getting the press he deserves.  Seattle wins, 24-20. </p>

                    <p>I predict a Steelers win, 21-10.</p>

<p>But then, I have the advantage of having read the results before making my prediction.</p>

<p>Either way would&#8217;ve been fine.  Xta loves Pittsburgh, and I&#8217;m very fond of Seattle.  (In both cases referring to the city, not to any of its sports teams.  But, eh, if the team of a city I like wins something, that&#8217;s fine by me.)</p>
