				<p>Today I did a big thing: I threw out all my white tube socks. All of them.</p><p>I&#8217;m not sure when I decided that white was the way to go, sock-wise. But I remember noticing them back in second grade. That would have been the Thriller era, the height of Michael&#8217;s power, when we were all wearing red shirts with black mesh and many-zippered jackets and things like that. Heck, my friend Tyson even had a single silver glove.</p><p>All our dads had plain black socks. Maybe sometimes brown or olive. But Michael had white ones. They peeked out from over his patent leather, under his high-water, tight pants: this was the look we all wanted.</p><p>Of course, being 7 I didn&#8217;t understand that his look was stylish because Michael was stylish. He could take any look and make it hot. Well, Diana from V&#8217;s jacket was hot first; but, those white socks? They were square. Not as bad as those thin, tall black dress socks our dads wore, but square nonetheless.</p><p>So our white socks were great for everyday and for sports, which was a big bonus. Except, if you&#8217;re the average, marginal-on-style white guy of middling size, like me, they just never could look good on you.</p><p>So now I got all sorts of thick, comfortable, striped and patterned socks. In bright colors. Because, if you&#8217;re a white guy of middling size, you might as well be bright and obnoxious about the ankles. Because there is nothing you can do to be like Michael Jackson circa 1982.</p>
