				<p>My favorite cooking method is probably roasting. It&#8217;s simple, it&#8217;s tasty, it&#8217;s easy, and it&#8217;s good for so many different foods. I love roasting and find it a lot of fun. So, lacking any particular inspiration for a food to cook this week, I decided to roast. I picked out a nice, inexpensive piece of beef at Whole Foods and got going.</p>
				
				<p>There are a lot of fun things to do with meat you&#8217;re roasting. If it has a skin, you can slip garlic and herbs under the skin. If it has a hole in the middle, you can stuff it with apples or lemons. For beef, I often cut small slits in the outside and stuff in garlic and rosemary. But this time I decided to try a dry rub. I rubbed the meat with a mixture of crushed green peppercorns, rock salt, cumin and coriander:<br />

<img src="/images/roast/closeraw.jpg" alt="a close-up of said piece of meat; see the seasonings on the skin" />
I then left the meat, uncovered, in the fridge to cure for an hour. Now, I could have cured it longer, say, overnight, but I needed dinner.</p>

<p>Most cookbooks tell you to roast by sticking the meat in a 350&deg;oven until it&#8217;s done. But half of the good part of a roast is the lovely caramelized crust on the outside, and 350&deg; will never give you a crust. <a href="http://altonbrown.com">Alton Brown</a> has a good suggestion in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1584790830/--">his book</a> cook the roast at 200&deg; until it reaches the desired internal temperature, then remove it from the oven, heat the oven to 500&deg;, replace the roast, and scorch the roast&#8217;s outside for about 15 minutes. I&#8217;ve used this technique several times, and it really works.<br />

<p>After removing the roast from the oven, I let it cool on a cutting board for a half hour &#8212; anything coming out of a hot oven cooks for a while just from the heat contained within, and it&#8217;s important to let a roast finish cooking. While the roast rested, I made a simple jus from the leavings in the pan. A splash of some white wine vinegar and a couple of cups of water made for perfect deglazing; once all of the good browned juices were lifted from the roasting pan, I threw in a few icecubes of frozen turkey stock. The result was a great, light jus. <br />
