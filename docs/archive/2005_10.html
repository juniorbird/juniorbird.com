							<h3>Things I Learned At The Marshall Halloween Party</h3>
							<p class="date">Oct 29, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Life is a series of lessons, often painful and traumatic. It&#8217;s at times like these that we need to write down the lessons we learn so that we don&#8217;t have to undergo these trials again. Simple, clear lessons can often be distilled from life&#8217;s most awful experiences, and set down, for review as we all strive and grow.</p>

<p>Of course, sometimes those lessons come from alcohol, friends, and excessively loud music. Then they&#8217;re just fun. Here&#8217;s what I learned at the Marshall Halloween party. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002011.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>The Me Stress Test</h3>
							<p class="date">Oct 25, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_otherwise_uncategorized.html">Otherwise Uncategorized</a></p>
						    	
							<p>One thing about me, if you know me (and are lucky enough to come by my apartment and spend some time in front of my Outlook), it&#8217;s easy to tell how stressed out I am by looking at a few simple metrics. These metrics are:</p>


<ol>
<li>What I&#8217;m reading</li>
<li>How may e-mails there are in my inbox <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002003.html">Read on&#8230;</a></li>

							<h3>Downtown LA (In Black & White)</h3>
							<p class="date">Oct 21, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_photos.html">Photos</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I haven&#8217;t shot black-and-white film since college, but, now that I&#8217;m back into photography, I&#8217;ve been itching for the chance. Well, itching and fearing it; it&#8217;s very different to shoot black-and-white than it is to shoot color. With color film, you&#8217;re trying to reporduce the world as it is, or to highlight certain juxtapositions of colors, while, for black-and-white, you&#8217;re more interested in shapes, lines, tones, and patterns. This is a different task, and, hardest of all, requires a set of thought processes that are very different from the visual thought processes that one uses when going through the world. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001979.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>D&iacute;a de Fiascos</h3>

							<p>Today was an interesting day, a day that offered me a unique range of the experiences avaialable at business school. Or &#8212; in another way to look at it &#8212; I got to build up my bad karma, then reap the rewards. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001977.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Back on Top</h3>

							<p>I got back on track tonight with a win in the cooking competition. My Thai Beef Noodles turned out tasty &#8212; I believe the flavor was described by one of my competitors as &#8220;very smooth.&#8221; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001974.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>2-3, 2-3, and Now 3-1</h3>

							<p>I love to compete, so it&#8217;s no surprise that I&#8217;m in two Fantasy Football leagues and one weekly cooking competition; I like to win, too, which is why it&#8217;s a little bit surprising that I&#8217;m 2-3 in both leagues and, now, have dropped from 3-0 to 3-1 in the cooking competition. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001957.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>First Flu of the Season</h3>
							<p class="date">Oct 12, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I thought it might be important for you, the two members of my reading public, that I post before I die of what may in fact be the Deadly Avian Flu (certainly, I am regularly exposed to a bird).</p>

<p>Actually, this is a pretty miserable thing I&#8217;ve got, whatever it is. Congestion, fever, aches &#8212; sounds like a flu of some sort. I can&#8217;t believe it so early in the year, I&#8217;m usually one of the last people to get the flu. While everyone is getting sick in November and December, I typically last &#8216;til February or even April, when people just think I&#8217;m making up this whole &#8220;flu&#8221; thing.  <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001953.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>This Entry Has Nothing To Do With Sarajevo</h3>

							<p>Apparently, my friends thought it was about time I got out of the house, &#8216;cause <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/karayzieho/">Christie</a> came all the way down from a vacation in Santa Barbara to drag me out to the <a href="http://www.franzferdinand.co.uk/blog.php">Franz Ferdinand</a> show at the Greek Theater last night. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001942.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>A Bite Here, A Bite There</h3>
							<p class="date">Oct  7, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a></p>
						    	
							<p>One of the things we do a billion of here in b-school is <a href="http://cleverbird.com/wiki/InformationalInterviews/InformationalInterviews">informational interviews</a>.  The goals of these interviews are typically to learn which skills we need to broadcast in order to get into an industry, as well as make a contact in the industry who can later point us to jobs. I always try to tack on to that a few questions about how I can get the most out of the remainder of my <span class="caps">MBA </span>education. The guy I was speaking with on Wednesday had what I&#8217;ve come to realize is an excellent insight: there&#8217;s not enough time in an <span class="caps">MBA </span>to learn everything you&#8217;d like, but that first class in an area outside of your concentration will give you a lot more learning than that fifth class inside your concentration. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001940.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Tarred With The One Brush</h3>
							<p class="date">Oct  4, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Something sometimes happens in b-school, something that scares me as someone who&#8217;s seen it from the outside. In b-school, there&#8217;s group projects in every class; and, every now and then, there&#8217;s a group member who doesn&#8217;t contribute. News of this individual&#8217;s worthlessness in a group spreads quickly, and, soon, if you mention that person&#8217;s in your team, you get snickers from other hard-working people. Soon, wherever you go, that person is known as a Bad Team Member. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001926.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>I'm a Bad Democrat</h3>
							<p class="date">Oct  3, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_ye_olde_politicks.html">Ye Olde Politicks</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Um, yeah. I have a confession to make. I&#8217;m a lifelong, vote-the-party-line Democrat. I think the Republican party is an evil, reactionary, racist, corrupt party. But I don&#8217;t think that Bush&#8217;s nominee for the Supreme Court is all that bad. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001924.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>I Live In a Town Filled With Stars</h3>
							<p class="date">Oct  2, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_otherwise_uncategorized.html">Otherwise Uncategorized</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Today, I went to the supermarket &#8212; by which I mean Payless Produce, Halal Carneceria, and 89&cent; store &#8212; earlier than usual, and ended up waiting in line quite some time next to a woman who claimed to be the mother of <span class="caps">WWE </span>star &#8220;Chris &#8220;The Master&#8221; Masters&#8221;:http://www.wwe.com/superstars/raw/chrismasters/. She was dressed for the place, in a ratty, off-the-shoulder, hot-in-1992 print sundress, to go with her probably hot-in-1988 boobs, which were rarin&#8217; to pop out of that thing. With big, cheap, dark plastic sunglasses &#8212; probably to hide her pinpointed, tweaker pupils &#8212; overtanned skin, overeprocessed, brittle-looking long brown hair, and sexy-in-1990 pink lipstick, she leaned in too close to tell me the following, which I swear is all verbatim: <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001910.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
