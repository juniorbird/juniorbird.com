				<p><span class="caps">OK, </span>let me lead this one off by clarifying. I often joke that I live in the ghetto; at the same time, I&#8217;ve never felt unsafe in my neighborhood. Everyone&#8217;s nice. That said, there&#8217;s either a high-speed chase going right by here or an <span class="caps">LAPD </span>chopper hovering over here once a month. And what do I ever hear about it? It&#8217;s not in the LA Times (they only have <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/homicidereport/">a blog to cover murders</a>, and even that&#8217;s a day behind), it&#8217;s not on <a href="http://cbs2.com/"><span class="caps">KCAL</span> 9</a>. But, gosh, it seems to be important enough at the moment, given the number of sirens I hear and what I imagine is the cost of keeping a chopper in the air.</p>

<p>So, why isn&#8217;t there a source for news about what&#8217;s going on in my neighborhood? I&#8217;m sure that news choppers are often up there following the chase, it&#8217;s just that the newsroom doesn&#8217;t feel like putting it on. Why not let me watch streaming video online or something? Or, the <span class="caps">LAPD </span>could have a blog with officers&#8217; reports &#8212; names and addresses redacted, of course &#8212; that told people about what was happening in each division.</p>

<p>Now, let&#8217;s not get bogged down in technicalities. Sure, there are legal issues, but, hey, this is supposed to be about being a community. Letting me keep up on things would let me help! Or at least be nosy. At any rate, this is what I want. So, how do we get it done? And why isn&#8217;t it already done?</p>

<p>Seriously, I need to know if I really needed to lock my door when the hovering <span class="caps">LAPD </span>chopper sent its spotlight beam into my driveway earlier this evening. &#8216;Cause I would&#8217;ve rather been out there watching the show!</p>
