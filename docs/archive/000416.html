				<p>Admit weekend: a chance to get to know a school or an emotional roller coaster? Find out in today&#8217;s episode!</p>
				
				<p>So, by early Friday I&#8217;d begun to think of myself as a Trojan. I was in <span class="caps">USC, </span>waitlisted elsewhere, and perhaps I&#8217;d just go where they wanted me (although perhaps Groucho would disagree with that approach).</p>

<p>Then I went to the first afternoon of events, and I thought, boy, maybe this isn&#8217;t such a good idea after all. I came home, had McDonalds to assuage my soul, and set out to Saturday&#8217;s events.</p>

<p>fortunately, I enjoyed Saturday a lot more. Friday, I think, was some bad luck: I didn&#8217;t much care for the presentation given by a finance professor, Suh-Pyng Ku, or the talk from Program Director Lida Jennings. I&#8217;m not sure there was any fundamental problem with either Dr. Ku or Ms. Jennings; in the morning, I spoke with some other attendees and found that some didn&#8217;t dig Dr. Ku and some didn&#8217;t go for the talks from other professors. In the case of Director Jenning&#8217;s speech, I think I was just too skeptical for my own good; there were enough unfulfilled promises in my undergrad experience that I don&#8217;t tend to buy  what the administration says. I&#8217;ll have to change my attitude to take full advantage of business school.</p>

<p>So I don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;ve brought anything specifically against Marshall away from this experience. I don&#8217;t love the school more than I started out, and I did want to after this weekend, but I don&#8217;t like it any less. At any school, I won&#8217;t care much for one professor or the other. So, I&#8217;m probably a Trojan.</p>

<p>But we&#8217;ll see what happens if <span class="caps">NYU </span>lets me in.</p>
