				<p>Tired of all of those surveys made up by high school kids? (no offense). Here are questions for the people who are a little older. Copy and paste into your own note, then answer the questions. Finally, tag your friends including me, please!</p>

<p>1. What bill do you hate paying the most?<br />
I hate the <span class="caps">DWP </span>bill the most, because so much of it goes to water the enormous lawn. You know, the mass of green grass in the middle of the desert. For style&#8217;s sake.</p>

<p>2. Do you miss being a child?<br />
Tons. Voltron was awesome.</p>

<p>3. Chore you hate the most?<br />
Any kind of cleaning that doesn&#8217;t take place in the kitchen is like being shanked with an unsharpened prison toothbrush.</p>

<p>4. Where was the last place you had a romantic dinner?<br />
On my proposal night! It worked, too &#8212; she said yes!</p>

<p>5. If you could go back and change one thing what would it be?<br />
I would&#8217;ve played team sports starting much earlier. Not that I&#8217;m good at sports, but it builds character. And I&#8217;m not enough of a character.</p>

<p>6. Name of your first grade teacher?<br />
Mrs. Boyle? No, that was second grade. I actually don&#8217;t remember!</p>

<p>7. What do you really want to be doing right now?<br />
I want pie. Or coconut cake. Mmm, dessert.</p>

<p>8. What did you want to be when you grew up?<br />
An architect. I always liked answering the question &#8220;how do you fit all that in such a small place?&#8221;</p>

<p>9. How many colleges did you attend?<br />
I went to Pomona College, which is affiliated with 4 other colleges and a graduate school of theology that are all next door. I took classes at 3 of those other colleges, which you can count either as one college or as 3. Also I took 2 summer school classes at <span class="caps">UCLA </span>one year. So, depending on how you count, either 1, 2, or 6.</p>

<p>10. Why did you choose the shirt that you have on right now?<br />
I like being the only one in the &#8216;hood with Portuguese on my shirt!</p>

<p>11. What are your thoughts on gas prices?<br />
Too many externalities in that market.</p>

<p>12. First thought when the alarm went off this morning?<br />
Today: yay Saturday, no alarm! Yesterday: quick quick gym gym.</p>

<p>13. Last thought before going to sleep last night?<br />
How did it get so late?</p>

<p>14. What famous person would you like to have dinner with?<br />
I&#8217;ll take them all!</p>

<p>15. Have you ever crashed your vehicle?<br />
I was a very bad teenage driver.</p>

<p>16. If you didn&#8217;t have to work, would you volunteer?<br />
Yes, boredom is the enemy.</p>

<p>17. Get up early or sleep in?<br />
Get up early! The gym is not so busy at 6am. And a ton seems to happen when the day starts that early.</p>

<p>18. What is your favorite cartoon character?<br />
First, this question should be &#8220;who.&#8221; Second, I feel a lot like Brain lately.</p>

<p>20. When did you first start feeling old?<br />
When I realized that the character of Bones on the TV show Bones is younger than me.</p>

<p>21. Favorite lunch meat?<br />
Roast Beef</p>

<p>22. What do you get every time you go into Walmart?<br />
Haven&#8217;t been in a decade.</p>

<p>23. Do you think marriage is an outdated ritual?<br />
Nah, I think it&#8217;s gonna be awesome!</p>

<p>24. Favorite movie you wouldn&#8217;t want anyone to find out about?<br />
I don&#8217;t want you to find out about it either!</p>

<p>25. What&#8217;s your favorite drink?<br />
Nice, peaty Scotch.</p>

<p>26. Who[m] from high school would you like to run in to?<br />
Paul Harnik and Serge Blok.</p>

<p>27. What radio station is your car radio tuned to right now?<br />
That one radio station that always plays Pokerface. </p>

<p>28. Sopranos or Desperate Housewives?<br />
Sopranos.</p>

<p>29. Worst relationship mistake that you wish you could take back?<br />
Well, every good mistake you learn something from. I wouldn&#8217;t trade those lessons for anything.</p>

<p>30. Do you like the person that sits directly across from you at work?<br />
I work from home, or, at my big current client, in an office that faces a wall. No people: just how I like it.</p>

<p>31. Have you ever had to use a fire extinguisher for its intended purposes?<br />
You mean to liven up a party?</p>

<p>32. Last book you finished reading?<br />
Some mystery. Reading a lot of mysteries lately.</p>

<p>33. Do you have a teddy bear?<br />
I have a stuffed tiger I&#8217;ve had since I was 3 or so.</p>

<p>34. Do you go to church?<br />
Nor synagogue.</p>

<p>35. How old are you?<br />
Pushin&#8217; 34.</p>
