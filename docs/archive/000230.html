				<p>For many years, I imagined that my next test would be the <span class="caps">GRE, </span>either in Poli Sci or Psychology, depending on whether I wanted to be a spook for the <span class="caps">CIA </span>or an industrial psychologist modeling workplace behavior. Well, it turns out I&#8217;m taking the <span class="caps">GMAT </span>instead.</p>
				
				<p>Being entirely unfamiliar with the <span class="caps">GMAT,</span> I was able to approach the coming of the test with no apprehension whatsoever. After all, I got a good score on my <span class="caps">SAT </span>and, in fact, was pretty good at standardized tests starting in junior high, when I figured out that I should actually care about these fill-in-the-bubble tests they made us take. But it&#8217;s a big test, so I figured I should prep a little.</p>

<p>My first step was to determine how hard-core I needed to be about my prepping &#8212; did I need to take a course, or would the small improvement I got from a prep book do the job? To answer this, I went to <a href="http://mba.com">mba.com</a> and downloaded their <span class="caps">POWERPREP </span>software. Then I sat me down for an afternoon and took one of the two practice tests.</p>

<p>The results? Not bad &#8212; 660 total, in the 97th percentile on language but only the 50-somethingth in math. Okay, so math needs a bit of work, I&#8217;ve always had a bit of trouble with the math on standardized tests (but not, surprisingly enough, that from programming or from statistical analysis).</p>

<p>I bought myself a <span class="caps">GMAT </span>prep book from the Princeton Review, the kind folks whose book got me an extra 100-some points on the <span class="caps">SAT.</span> Now it&#8217;s time to crack it open and dive in. I&#8217;m looking forward to the practice! And I&#8217;d better work hard, because that <span class="caps">GMAT </span>is in about three weeks.</p>
