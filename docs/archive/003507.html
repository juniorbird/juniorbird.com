				<p>I was sitting at my computer the other day when I saw an unexpected visitor outside my window &#8212; a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Warbler">Yellow Warbler</a>. Warblers are small, bright birds with lovely singing voices. They&#8217;re also classic subjects for birdwatching travels &#8212; a summer getaway to Texas or Georgia can net a Californian several exciting additions to their <a href="http://www.backyardnature.net/birdlist.htm">life list</a>, provided that the birder is patient.</p>

<p><img src="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/photos/202543889-M.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Patience is important because, for brightly-colored birds, warblers are hard to spot. They flit around, blend well into deciduous foliage, and are generally shy. I spent a couple of weeks in Texas with my college girlfriend, an avid birder, seeking out warblers for hours a day, at the end of dirt roads and far too near ramshackle homes with &#8220;trespassers will be shot&#8221; clearly labeled on the barbed-wire fences.</p>

<p>Yellow Warblers are common in this part of the country, but not in urban areas &#8212; Warblers in general like bucolic spots. So, seeing one in my backyard was quite the treat. </p>

<p><img src="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/photos/202543572-M.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Birdwatching is surprisingly relaxing provided you&#8217;re prepared to keep your sights low. A long life list doesn&#8217;t come from spending time in, you know, places that are easy to get to. And that&#8217;s not relaxing. Staying in my backyard is relaxing.</p>

<p><img src="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/photos/202544147-M.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>See those bars on the wings? Those, plus, in the next photo, the vertical stripes on the chest and the dark stripe across the eye, are what birders call &#8220;diagnostics&#8221; &#8212; things that you can use to distinguish exactly what bird you&#8217;re looking at. </p>

<p><img src="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/photos/202546814-M.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve had a few other visitors in the past couple of weeks &#8212; notably, a ton of hummingbirds.</p>

<p><img src="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/photos/202547870-M.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I guess that means it&#8217;s probably migration season &#8212; a great time for birding. I should look up some of the easy spots we used to go to, they made for nice afternoon walks in green areas, with some fun sightings along the way. A good way to use the fast-departing summer sunlight!</p>

                    <p>Hi Wade. I am happy to hear you recognize and are enjoying our birdy visitors! Hummingbirds have been visiting my patio and mourning doves come sometimes. I am shocked you saw a yellow warbler. It&#8217;s pretty. Sweet sighting. The only warblers I&#8217;ve seen were in Carmel and Big Sur but they were yellow crowned warblers, black, grey, and white striped bodies with yellow heads. What&#8217;s a life list? </p>

                    <p>Hi Wade. Thanks! <br />
Thanks for the pic. of theTownsend&#8217;s Warbler. No, I didn&#8217;t see that Warbler, so I took a few minutes and looked up Warblers common to my area and I found two that match what I&#8217;ve spotted up there, the Chestnut sided and Orange Crowned. Now, on my walks with Boony here, I&#8217;m on the look out for Warblers!  </p>
