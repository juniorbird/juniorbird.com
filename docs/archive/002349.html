				<p>For weeks, my absent-minded friend Stu has been threatening to invite us all over to his house for an Iron Chef-style battle; finally, Friday night, he delivered. Or, maybe more accurately, we delivered, and he hosted.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, he announced: battle pork. On Thursday, I learned that I&#8217;d be up against a 19 lb. roast. Friday night, I came into his modern, open Santa Monica house and met my first competiton: a cute couple making Carbonara sauce. Soon, the big man with the immense roast showed up too, followed by a last-minute entrant with risotto, and a gourmet who made a fried, stuffed, and steamed tofu dish she made up from disparate Chinese dishes.</p>

<p>I came in with a double whammy: barbecued pork burgers and pork lo mein. At first, I was excited to cook two dishes representing the breadth of American cuisine, but had not anticipated the profusion of Asian guests at this event; such an audience for my lo mein was, to say the least, intimidating.</p>

<p>More intimadating was the food. First up was bruschetta, from the carbonara crew; it was pretty much perfect. The carbonara was creamy and the sauce was properly-tempered, the eggs not scrambled even a little. Then came the risotto, which was creamy and tasty, followed by the tofu, which was incredibly distinctive and Chinese-tasting and challenging to my palate, and accompanied by some sort of braised pork short ribs or something.</p>

<p>I had done all of my prep work earlier, so, when most of the guests had dug into the tofu, I headed back to the kitchen and cooked me up a few tasty barbequed pork burgers, topped with barbecue sauce and caramelized onions. Those got a bit of an audience, but the 19 pounds of meat overshadowed that; especially the big 12-ounce slices that they cut (well, not for everyone, somebody got what must&#8217;ve been 32 oz. of meat).</p>

<p>So then, for me, it was back to the kitchen for me, to make the Lo Mein. Now that was a strong recipe, the sauce turned out silky and tasty and authentic and the audience loved it. But I was too full to eat more. I was, verily, stuffed full of pork. And wine, and good company. But mostly pork.</p>
