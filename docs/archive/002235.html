				<p>If you&#8217;re interested in classifying yourself &#8212; and goodness knows, I classify everything so such an exercise certainly appeals to me &#8212; a good place to start might be the <a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes1.htm">Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</a>, a scientifically un-validated test that classifies everyone into one of 16 groups with four-letter names. I&#8217;m an <span class="caps">INTJ</span>; every time I&#8217;ve taken the <span class="caps">MBTI </span>&#8212; whether a fake version online I found in college or the real, authorized one I took in b-school or the several in between &#8212; I&#8217;ve come out an <span class="caps">INTJ.</span> But I took this other test for a class, the <a href="http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/j/5/j5j/IPIP/"><span class="caps">IPIP</span>-NEO</a>, and, well, the overlap between the two makes it clear that I&#8217;m in that little box formerly labeled <a href="http://www.biercephile.com/">Misanthrope</a>.</p>

<p>Now, if you&#8217;re as compulsive a categorizer as I, then you&#8217;ve already taken those two tests linked above, gotten your results, and taken some time to understand them. If, however, you&#8217;re reading this blog voluntarily, you&#8217;re probably bored and wishing I&#8217;d get on with making sense already. So, for the benefit of those who haven&#8217;t read their classification explanations, an <span class="caps">INTJ </span>is:</p>


<ul>
<li>An Introvert, meaning I am energized by being alone, that being around others saps my energy, and that I enjoy spending time with my own thoughts. Which, frankly, explains why I put them down here rather than inviting you all over for dinner, then holding forth.</li>
<li>An Intuiter, meaning that I noodle on everything and, by doing so, understand everything, rather than having to physically experience everything.</li>
<li>A Thinker, meaning that I like to put ideas and impressions together with logic, rather than with emotions.</li>
<li>A Judger, meaning not that I&#8217;m judgemental but rather that I prefer to be systematic in my thinking and in my life progression.</li>
</ul>



<p>All the above is probably obvious to anybody who&#8217;s spent more than about 20 minutes with me. But, when you take the above definition in tandem with my <span class="caps">IPIP</span>-NEO result, well, you can narrow down the possiblities quite a bit.</p>

<p>The <span class="caps">IPIP</span>-NEO classifies the subject on five &#8220;domains&#8221;, each with several sub-scales. On each sub-scale and each domain, the subject is rated on a scale of 1-100, with 50 being &#8220;average&#8221; for people from the relevant culture and age group, and 0 being low and 100 high. I got:</p>


<ul>
<li>43 on Extraversion, which is close to normal but please note the <em>3</em> on the Friendliness sub-scale. I hope that, as the description says, &#8220;an introvert who scores high on the agreeableness dimension will not seek others out but will be quite pleasant when approached&#8221; will turn out to be true!</li>
<li>60 on Agreeableness, which makes me happy, except for the 18 on the Modesty sub-scale and the 29 on the Morality sub-scale, which, from the definition, should really be called Bluntness as it measures only propensity to speak diplomatically, at which I am surprisingly good.</li>
<li>36 on Conscientiousness, with a stunning 0 on the Dutifulness and 9 on Self-Discipline sub-scales &#8212; <span class="caps">OK, </span>we all knew I had a problem with authority and that maybe I need to shape up some &#8212; but at least the 91 on the Achievement-Striving sub-scale is predictable.</li>
<li>80 on Neuroticism, which frankly I think is low for a Jew. 89 on the Self-Consciousness sub-scale, 81 on Anxiety, and 86 on Depression were all predictable, but I&#8217;m happy to see that I scored only 35 on Anger. Really, I think the Depression scale is exaggerated, as I&#8217;m good at finding the sunshine after allowing myself a bit of rain from time to time.</li>
<li>77 on Openness to Experience, with an 89 on the Imagination sub-scale and 87 on Liberalism.</li>
</ul>



<p>So what does this all tell us? Well, put it together and I&#8217;m an introverted, unfriendly, perhaps approachable, logical intellecutal who is somewhat messy and maybe doesn&#8217;t follow through (or maybe is a perfectionist) and who worries all the time, especially when trying new things. Alone. That&#8217;s a pretty accurate box to put &#8216;ol me in, and I offer it as a convenience to you all out there, my beloved readers.</p>

                    <p>I am flabbergasted by how alike we are in many ways.  INTJs are few and far between, and I have tested as one more than once.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t wait to take the IPIP-NEO.  It&#8217;s nice to see a personality trait that I berate myself for daily written about in a scientific, non-judgmental way.  I too am unfriendly yet agreeable, and I hope to embrace that rather than continuing to feel bad about not seeking others out.  </p>

<p>Ever since I was small I wanted to be more of a social butterfly, because those girls had friends and I didn&#8217;t.  Fortunately I gathered more and more friends as the years passed, slowly, as people approached me and realized how agreeable I was.</p>

                    <p>Dot keeps fluctuating every time she takes MB, and on 3 of the categories.  Now, is it because she is truly on the border in those areas&#8230; or because of the internal struggle between who she really is and who she wants to be?  Hmmm.  :D</p>

                    <p>I&#8217;m a NT.  I test right on the borderline for the I/E and P/J axes.  My N is pretty solid, around 60-65% (defining 50% as equal N/S), and my T is a perfect 100%.  (And I will never, ever date anyone who gets an F on the M-B.  In fact, I have trouble even being friends with Fs.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always thought Abstract/Concrete was a better description of Intuiting/Sensing.  And for Perceiving/Judging, they might try Dynamic/Systematic.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#8217;ll try that other test some time when I&#8217;m not four days behind on reading LJ and Slate, because I&#8217;ve been doing non-stop <em>work</em> at work, instead of being able to spend lunch hour browsing the web&#8230;</p>
