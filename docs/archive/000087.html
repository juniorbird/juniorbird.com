				<p>One of the first things I discovered when I started to take cooking seriously as a hobby was just how important having a good knife is. For most home cooks, three or four good knives are enough &#8212; and spending just a little bit of money on them pays off big-time!</p>

<p>These are my knives:<br />
<img src="/images/knifestore/myknives.jpg" alt="three knives, one 8 in. long, one 6 in. chef's, one 4 in. chopper" />
Yes, I know, somehow I get along with no paring knife &#8212; I must be a philistine, especially in my presentation. In all honesty, I do wish the 8&#34; knife were a 10&#34;. I&#8217;d get more use from it then &#8212; it&#8217;s a little too close in length to the 6&#34; chef&#8217;s knife in the middle. All three are great knives; the top and bottom are Globals, a trendy Japanese knife that gets oh so sharp, while the middle one is a nice reliable W&uuml;sthof. All well-weighted full-tang beauties with that will last until I decide to splurge on that plasma vibro-knife after my big promotion in 2035.</p>

<p>The Globals were originally procured at the somewhat intimidating <a href="http://ypng.infospace.com/_1_24YLTO10UVNRZO__info.zip/ypv3/detail.htm?qb=&amp;recid=0018230467&amp;xmlurl=http%3A%2F%2Fyp110.superpages.com%2Fxml%2Fdetail.phtml%3FT%3Dbeverly%2Bhills%26N%3Dstandard%2Bcutlery%26PG%3DL%26R%3DN%26SRC%3DInfospace%26S%3Dca%26AL%3D%26MC%3D%26map.x%3D212%26map.y%3D125%26level%3D8%26lat%3D034070477%26lng%3D-118404607%26POI1lat%3D034070477%26POI1lng%3D-118404607%26POI1name%3DStandard%2BCutlery%2B%2526%2BSupply%2BCO%26streetaddress%3D9509%2BSanta%2BMonica%2BBoulevard%26city%3DBeverly%2BHills%26state%3DCA%26zip%3D90210%26LID%3D0018230467%26LS%3D%26display%3D1%26AD%3D%26GV%3D0%26GL%3D%26FN%3D%26PP%3DN%26CID%3D&amp;kcfg=ypus&amp;ypinsp=0&amp;resolve=location&amp;searchtype=all&amp;fromform=qsearch&amp;qhqn=standard+cutlery&amp;qn=standard+cutlery&amp;qc=beverly+hills&amp;qs=ca&amp;qk=15&amp;recid=0018230467">Standard Cutlery &amp; Supply Company</a> in Beverly Hills. I say intimidating for two reasons:</p>


<ol>
<li>The staff is all quite knowledgeable about knives and will call you on any mistakes you make in discussing your desired cutlery with them.</li>
<li>The guy who does the sharpening will call you out for any signs of abuse to your blade.</li>
<li>They stock a crapload of knives.</li>
</ol>



<p>This is what you are surrounded by when you enter the store:<br />
<img src="/images/knifestore/knifecase.jpg" alt="display cases of knife after knife" /></p>

<p>And this is what you see behind the counter:<br />
<img src="/images/knifestore/manyknives.jpg" alt="easily 50 knives behind the counter" /></p>

<p>Ah! Here are more Globals! Drool&#8230;<br />
<img src="/images/knifestore/globals.jpg" alt="a wide selection of knives by the Global company" /></p>

<p>I picked up a few knives to give as gifts to a few friends who love to cook; the nice people at Standard sold me some nice stuff for just $30-$50, good starter knives that my friends can do awful things to without feeling guilty.</p>

<p>In a month or so, I&#8217;ll need to get my knives sharpened, they&#8217;re starting to really show their use. The only challenge then will be to suppress my lust for a good cleaver and a passable parer. Remarkably enough, I&#8217;m actually thinking of going serrated for that latter item.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d love to get a flexible boning knife but it won&#8217;t be until I save up enough $$$ to take some real cooking school classes that I&#8217;ll know how to use such a thing.</p>

                    <p>Wade&#8230;Wade&#8230; Wade&#8230; I could&#8217;ve showed you the way. I got a set of Ginsu(like) knives on eBay a couple of years ago for $0.25 yes a quarter plus s/h (actually my Ex bought them, he went all out for me) and I swear they are the best, especially for cutting chicken, both raw and cooked. </p>
