				<p>I did it. I broke down and bought a Windows laptop for my forthcoming business school experience. At the end, I just felt that the easy interoperability with my classmates and access to all of the desktop and web apps used by Marshall was worth it. Plus, I&#8217;m very hopeful that it won&#8217;t be so awful now that Microsoft has had 20 years to imitate the Mac OS in some little way.</p>

<p>So today (only a week and a half after ordering!) I recieved that laptop. A Dell <a href="http://www1.us.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/latit_d600?c=us&amp;cs=22&amp;l=en&amp;s=dfh">Latitude <span class="caps">D600</span></a>. The out-of-box experience wasn&#8217;t bad, althoughDell showed clearly nothing like the care Apple puts into packaging. The box was at least easy-to-open and the contents easy-to-get-at, despite the brown cardboard.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d ordered Office and Norton Anti-Virus pre-installed, and those worked just fine. Everything &#8212; even the OS &#8212; came with install CDs. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi were pre-installed, and worked with no fiddling around.</p>

<p>Of course, the machine doesn&#8217;t look as pretty as a Mac. But all parts seem to work fine thus far. And, just as naturally, it feels weird to use. But a lot of that is just getting used to it as well. So, we&#8217;ll see, over the next few weeks, just how big a mistake this was!</p>

<p>(hopefully neither big nor a mistake) </p>
