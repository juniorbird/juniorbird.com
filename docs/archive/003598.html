				<p>The night Rick died, his ex called me in the middle of the night to tell me. But her voicemail was unintelligible; and I was already up. I&#8217;d been up for an hour, and I&#8217;d spent that whole time in terror. Because I had awoken in the dark, suddenly sure he was coming to get me.</p>

<p>Of course, the concept was preposterous. I&#8217;d done nothing to him, and Rick was nothing if not fair. But I was sure of it. The thought was fixed in my mind when my eyes opened, and an hour of applications of logic had failed to knock it away. I sat there, trying to make up excuses that would save my skin, none growing into anything convincing &#8212; and how could they, given that I had nothing to excuse?</p>

<p>Then the phone rang, and, half-hoping I&#8217;d been asleep, I jumped. It was Rick&#8217;s ex, and I couldn&#8217;t imagine wanting to speak to her at 3:30 am. So I went to the bathroom, and sat on the toilet, in the dull light that trickles through the frosted glass at night, for a while. I listened to her voicemail, which was incoherent with static, and suddenly stopped worrying. It just lifted. And, after a while, I went back to sleep.</p>

                    <p>Good, good. I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re were able to process and go back to sleep.  <br />
But why, why were you afraid he was going to come get you? Is it because you&#8217;d helped him, you&#8217;d helped this troubled man in the past? And get you for what? to help him? Were you afraid he was going to take his anger out on you? </p>

                    <p>I don&#8217;t know. What could it have meant? Did I have some concern I hadn&#8217;t really been conscious of before? Or did I somehow feel his death and misinterpret that? It was a weird thing to feel, and a very strange time to feel it.</p>

                    <p>This morning when I woke up, I thought, you felt it. You felt him.  His spirit visited your spirit.. The feelings you described was his spirit and essence indeed. You are a gentle, sweet, sensitive spirit. You are powerful, receptive and intuitive.</p>
