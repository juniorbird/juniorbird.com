				<p>I love Christmas! Starting in about, oh, July, I quietly sing Christmas songs to myself. When the season comes along, I&#8217;m like a little child; I even look forward to the TV weather maps that show Santa&#8217;s position on Christmas Eve. All this regardless of the fact that I&#8217;m, technically, Jewish.</p>

<p>See, my mother&#8217;s Jewish and my father Methodist. When I was born, they decided not to confuse me and shuttle me between Saturday and Sunday services, so I was raised in a non-denominational way. But we still celebrated Christmas. It&#8217;s just a cultural thing &#8212; my parents were kind enough not to deprive me of the consumerist festival that takes place every winter. Which is cool, &#8216;cause I like things.</p>

<p>Our Christmases were extra-weird, because we haven&#8217;t had them at home with a nice tall tree and a roaring fire and all that. Up until I was five, we had classic Christmases at my grandparents&#8217; ranch, but when my grandpa passed on, my grandma sold the ranch and we began to celebrate Christmas in either my grandma&#8217;s apartment or in a hotel room in an exotic (well, usually less-than-exotic) vacation destination.</p>

<p>This year: grandma&#8217;s apartment in Houston. And here&#8217;s the pictures (we&#8217;re all dressed up for brunch).</p>

<p><img src="/images/xmas2004/presents.jpg" alt="presents around a poinsettia on a table" />
Everyone&#8217;s loot</p>

<p><img src="/images/xmas2004/santa.jpg" alt="dad in a santa hat" />
Santa&#8217;s here to give out gifts!</p>

<p><img src="/images/xmas2004/grandma.jpg" alt="my grandmother in a chair, smirking" />
Some people don&#8217;t like having their pictures taken, I guess</p>

<p><img src="/images/xmas2004/presenttime.jpg" alt="my grandmother opening a gift" />
They don&#8217;t seem to mind when they&#8217;ve got presents, do they?</p>

<p><img src="/images/xmas2004/timefordinner.jpg" alt="me in an apron" />
All the presents have been given out, so it must be time for me to cook dinner!</p>

<p>Okay, these pictures aren&#8217;t too festive. But then, as my Wonderful Girlfriend often points out, my family is way white.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve taken no pictures of the loot as, well, no loot for the Los-Angeles-residing members of this family; didn&#8217;t want to try to schlep boxes of stuff through Terrorist Alert Level Orange. And thus I am <em>muy antojado</em>. Without widgets and electronica and books and foodstuffs to touch and cherish, there&#8217;s this doubt in the back of my head that Christmas really came. Can I wait until I return to see my TiVo? Will it really be there when I return? Man, I want <strong>stuff</strong>!</p>
