				<p>I want a Treo 650. I covet a Treo 650. Remarkably, I even <em>need</em> a Treo 650. Yet, somehow, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a Treo 650 in the Greater Phoenix area. Truly, I am an oppressed victim of the system.</p>

<p>It all started when I got here on Saturday; no cell phone reception. Sunday, I drove around and got occasional reception. Monday, more driving around, less signal. I do not believe it is possible, in the 21st century, for an individual under 40 to live for an extended period without cell phone service. Certainly, I cannot live like that. Every day I make my way without this phone I think of more friends &#8212; good people, special people, people with whom, I admit, I haven&#8217;t spoken in a year &#8212; I need to call. It&#8217;s torture to actually have to interact with individuals geographically proximal to me for entertainment.</p>

<p>So, with no cell service, I did what anybody would do as a very last resort: I called Cingular. Apparently the Cingular network in Phoenix is provided by <span class="caps">AT&amp;T</span> Wireless (since acquired by Cingular), and my phone is too old to be compatible with that network. I have two choices:</p>


<ul>
<li>Get a new phone</li>
<li>Begin to live in the last century</li>
</ul>



<p>So I decided to get a new phone. I&#8217;d coveted the Treo 650 for some time now &#8212; it syncs with Outlook, it runs all sorts of programs, it&#8217;s got a keyboard, and it&#8217;s kinda slick-looking. I&#8217;ve had my Nokia 3650 for two years and I&#8217;ve got an upgrade coming to me, so I drove to the nearest Cingular store. The woman in line in front of me got the last Treo in the store; so I went to another store. No Treo there either! I called the third Cingular store and they were out too. Fry&#8217;s was, similarly, sold out, and Sprint was out-of-stock as well. Verizon only has the Treo 600 and I can&#8217;t live without Bluetooth.</p>

<p>Being a (for the moment) 21st-century inhabitant, I jumped on the Web to get a Treo. Well, Cingular&#8217;s Web site crashed on me, and the only vendors who would sell me a Treo and overnight it wanted over $500 for it. So I broke down and decided to speak with an actual human being and called 611 on my rommate&#8217;s Cingular phone. Can I use the word Cingular enough? Cingular Cingular Cingular.</p>

<p>Anyway so I called Cingular. Three times. No joy. Transferred into the ether; transferred to the wrong person; sorry, by now the department you&#8217;re calling is closed.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d get mad, but I want my gadget too much to think of anything but its imminent acquisition. I&#8217;ll get mad later. Until then, I need to decide:</p>


<ul>
<li>Do I call local stores every day to see if a Treo becomes available, and then drive over and acquire the item immediately?</li>
<li>Do I call Cingular and order the phone now, and wait 5 business days for it to be delivered?</li>
</ul>



<p>I want my Treo 650! Waaah!</p>

                    <p>i&#8217;d order it and wait the 5 bus days. i&#8217;ve been in similar situations before and because i wanted the item immediately, and thought for some reason that i could get it much faster than if it were mailed to me, i&#8217;d go searching all over town for it, never find it, then three days later wish i would&#8217;ve ordered it because it&#8217;d be only 2 more days &#8216;til i got it in the mail. i would call the stores, ask how long &#8216;til they get a shipment, then either wait or order online ASAP. salud!</p>

                    <p>That&#8217;s actually how I was thinking yesterday. Being a good business school student, however, I decided to build a model to help me see which approach I should take. This model contained a few assumptions:</p>


<ul>
<li>There was a 1/3 chance that, if I waited to get a phone, the Cingular store would get them in stock and sell out before I could get one for myself</li>
<li>The Cingular store had already re-ordered them and was anticipating delivery between Wednesday and Saturday (per my conversation with store staff)</li>
<li>If I ordered from customer service, the phone would take 3-6 <em>business</em> days to arrive</li>
<li>The odds of the phone arrriving were evenly distributed across all days on which the phone could arrive (except for rounding for convenience)</li>
<li>If I was unable to buy a Treo locally by Saturday, I would order one on the phone on Sunday</li>
</ul>



<p>So, the objective of this model is to pick the strategy that will give me the highest chance of having a Treo soon. Will it be:</p>


<ol>
<li>Try to get one locally, then order one on the phone on Sunday</li>
<li>Order it on the phone now</li>
</ol>



<p>Here&#8217;s how the odds worked out:</p>

StrategyWThFSaSuMTuWThFSaSuMTu<strong>1</strong>15%15%15%15%0%0%0%0%8%8%0%0%8%6%<strong>1-Cum</strong>15%30%45%60%60%60%60%60%68%76%76%76%84%100%<strong>2</strong>0%0%17%0%0%17%17%17%17%15%----<strong>2-Cum</strong>0%0%17%17%17%34%51%68%85%100%----

<p>So the first line is the chance that I&#8217;ll get the phone on a given day given strategy 1, and the second line is the cumulative chance that I will have recieved the phone on that day or on a previous day, again given strategy one, and so on for strategy two. As you can see, strategy two is only more optimal on next Thursday or afterwards; strategy one (try to buy the phone here) gives me a better chance of getting the Treo until that date, and a not much worse chance after that date. So I&#8217;m going with strategy 1.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t seen the &#8220;Brazillian Gay&#8221; ad but I guess I&#8217;m not too surprised, I have a lot of Brazil entries from PRIME. Google will do that to ya I guess!</p>
