				<p>A lot of us liberals were disappointed, although not surprised, to see <a href="http://video.msnbc.msn.com/martin-bashir/47480619/">the threat of a default over the debt ceiling</a> trotted out again. I mean, it seemed to us like the deal was: pass a budget, get the ability to stick to the budget. Apparently not. So I was annoyed, wondering, like many lefties, why compromise has suddenly become a code word for &#8220;why don&#8217;t you accept nothing while I just get my way,&#8221; when I realized, duh, there was nothing sudden about it. We started to hear about the evil of flip-flopping back in the &#8216;88 election, and that&#8217;s when we should&#8217;ve realized that our opponents weren&#8217;t talking about what they thought but, rather, what they believed, and that belief was on its way to replacing opinion. And where&#8217;s the room to meet in the middle on belief? Meeting in the middle with belief means giving up on the fundamental truth you believe in. &#8220;Jesus is the son of God&#8221; vs. &#8220;There is no God&#8221;: where can people on either of those ends compromise without selling out their fundamental beliefs?With today&#8217;s policy debates now faith-based - &#8220;trust in me and after we&#8217;re austere enough the capital-holders will reward us with growth&#8221; - why should political compromise be any different?No, the answer is that there&#8217;s no room for a deal, because the basis for negotiation never changes. And that&#8217;s ok: we can work with a consistent meaning of compromise, whatever that meaning is.</p>
