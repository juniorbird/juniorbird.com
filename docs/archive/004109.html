				<p>It&#8217;s my two year wedding anniversary. I used to hear people say things like &#8220;she&#8217;s the only one who understands me!&#8221; and I thought that was crap; how could it be that only one person in the world understands you? And then I met my wife. And she&#8217;s the only one who understands me.</p><p>Most people would describe me as easygoing, supportive, understanding, patient. I suppose I can occasionally be cranky, in a get-of-my-lawn-you-darned-kids kind of way, but I&#8217;m not the angry type.  Except sometimes, when I suddenly am angry at everyone. Talk to me? That&#8217;s a fightin&#8217;. Walk past me and not talk to me? Well, you must hate me and now I hate you too, so that&#8217;s a fightin&#8217;. Cut me off on the road? That&#8217;s a double fightin&#8217;! But it&#8217;s always been really an odd set of behavior, something that just didn&#8217;t fit in at all. I didn&#8217;t know what caused it, and it just made people I used to date really confused and defensive. (Act defensive? That&#8217;s a fightin&#8217;.)</p><p>Then, one day, the monster came out with Courtney. And, very calmly, she responded: you need a snack! (Propose a solution? That&#8217;s a fightin&#8217;!) Of course, I grumbled and wanted nothing to do with it, but I was hungry, so I had a snack. Not because she suggested it, but because I wanted one. And because she suggested it. <span class="caps">OK,</span> I was hungry, and I really needed a snack, and then I had one, and then I was in a good mood. (Good mood? That&#8217;s aâ€¦ ooo, the puppy&#8217;s sure cute!)</p><p>I don&#8217;t know how it took until I was 31, but, somehow, somebody understood me well enough to know that I got cranky when I got hungry. And that person, the only one who understands me? Of course, she&#8217;s my wife. Happy second anniversary baby, I&#8217;m so happy I married the only person in the world who really understands me!</p>
