				<p>I&#8217;m into the whole <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/04/21/minimalist-wallet/">minimalist wallet</a> thing &#8212; the slim look, the lack of pocket bulges (I get enough from my Treo), and the fact that I don&#8217;t schlep half of my office with me every time I leave the house all keep me happy. My last wallet, reasonably well-liked if not particularly perfect (the money clip thing was a good experiment, but not a success for me) fell apart and was discarded without too much fanfare or too many tears. Its replacement, however&#8230; well, I&#8217;m in love.</p>

<p><img src="/images/slimmy.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve gone through many generations of minimalist wallets, ever since I discovered that I didn&#8217;t like a big, overstuffed thing in my back pocket during the very beginning of college. And it&#8217;s great &#8212; I don&#8217;t need more than a few dollars, a few business cards, a credit card, an <span class="caps">ATM </span>card, my <span class="caps">ID, </span>and my insurance card at any given time during the day. </p>

<p>Now, the problem is that, while the billfold has been extensively perfected over generations, these smaller wallets are all cutting-edge technology, which means many just don&#8217;t work. Too few of the minimalist looks ever worked properly, and some didn&#8217;t even last a few months. I got some with too few pockets, with pockets that were too tight, and even with coin purses that didn&#8217;t close completely.</p>

<p>But not the <a href="http://koyono.com/products/slimmy/description.html">Slimmy</a> &#8212; it&#8217;s minimalist but it concentrates on just what&#8217;s needed in a wallet. It&#8217;s got enough pockets, but not too many; it holds its contents tight but not so tight you can&#8217;t get them out. It fits in my pocket comfortably and yet it lets me keep what I need with me. The leather has a great, supple grain, and the whole product feels soft and classy in my hand. I am definitely enthusiastic about my new Slimmy.</p>

                    <p>Well, empty, it&#8217;s about as thick as a quarter of a deck of cards, and it&#8217;s only slightly larger than a credit card in length and width. I think I should&#8217;ve gotten the kind with the red interior, however; it&#8217;s pretty spiffy. Still, my love is pretty much unbounded.</p>
