				<p>Darn. Well, the Colts won. Evil has triumphed in the world, not least because good appears to have been incompetent. What else is new? Thanks to the magic of gin and barbecue, I was able to make it through all three-and-some hours of depressing football, interspersed with remarkably mediocre ads<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003112.html#fn1">1</a></sup>. It&#8217;ll be ok. Actually, the whole Super Bowl experience kind of showed me where I need to set my expectations and plans in life.</p>

<p>Really, I knew the Colts would win. It was kind of like that last second before a car accident, when the other car has already pulled out in front of you but there&#8217;s no time to stop, so all you can see is that other car getting bigger and bigger and brace yourself for the crash and maybe you already smell that acrid &#8220;ouch I got hit!&#8221; smell in your nose, prepratory to the actual pain. I think I smelled that for the last two weeks. Good fuel for a smile of resignation, it was.</p>

<p>And then the game was just sad. With the opening kickoff return for a TD and the early interceptions, I actually got hope. That, I will say, was just not fair. Then the Bears got both outcoached and outplayed. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/01/AR2007020101817.html">Bad Rex</a>, <a href="http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/superbowl/worst.html">Tony Eason</a>. Tony Eason, Bad Rex. Here&#8217;s a few bucks, have a burger on me, boys.</p>

<p>So, as I said, this game showed me what I need to do in life. Those of you who know me well know that I&#8217;ve been planning to make enough to get my revenge on some who deserve it.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003112.html#fn2">2</a></sup> Well, that list has now been lengthened. I now know what my goal needs to be: I need to make enough money to buy the Colts, send the uniforms and records back to Baltimore, and move the team to the <a href="http://www.lacoliseum.com/">Coliseum</a>. It&#8217;s good to have goals, and even better to have a little bile to drive you to them.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Was Salesgenie actually serious about <a href="http://sb.salesgenie.com/LandingAdSB.aspx?bas_vendor=68331">that ad</a>? I mean, really? No, seriously? Um, wow.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> If you don&#8217;t know who, I&#8217;m not telling you on this blog, sorry.</p>
