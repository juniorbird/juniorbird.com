				<p>Right now, lying on my back on my bed in my hotel room, my bloated stomach in the air, I fear I must be channeling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nero_Wolfe">Nero Wolfe</a>. Well, insofar as I&#8217;m overindulging, not insofar as I&#8217;m solving crimes. And I must also say that I am killing the orchids I have, so maybe I&#8217;m not that much like Nero Wolfe. Except that I&#8217;m currently approaching hemispherical in profile, thanks to my most recent, outrageously large, dinner.</p>

<p>Usually this isn&#8217;t a problem. I&#8217;m a gourmet, yes, but not so much a gourmand. On my father&#8217;s side of the family, the body seems to regard the sensation of &#8220;full&#8221; as nothing more than a mild suggestion. On the other hand, on my mother&#8217;s side, the line between &#8220;full&#8221; and &#8220;feeling miserable&#8221; is but microns thick. I take after my mother&#8217;s side and am therefore averse to overeating. </p>

<p>Holiday-dependent gluttony hasn&#8217;t been a temptation either. Until a few years ago, when we went to Houston for Christmas we accepted that we were giving up any particular hopes of getting a good meal. This was true even back when we lived in Baltimore; Houston offered very little in the way of culinary delights. There was the good old <a href="http://csapartisan.tripod.com/essays/CONFHOUS.htm">Confederate House</a>, which offered two kinds of fish and four kinds of meat, all in cream sauce. Unfortunately, we couldn&#8217;t go there because they could tell my mother was Jewish and so snuck a cigarette butt in her coffee. There was <a href="http://houston.citysearch.com/profile/9873519/houston_tx/the_stables.html">the Stables</a>, which served mediocre cuts of meat, cooked just right<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003031.html#fn1">1</a></sup>, with big baked potatoes on the side. And&#8230; well, that was about it. I guess there was undifferentiated Tex-Mex as well. Which was ok. I mean, we came to Houston to see my grandma, not to gourmandize<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003031.html#fn2">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>But, in the last few years, the side objective of eating well has slowly become achievable. And, this year, we&#8217;ve done exceptionally well at it. We got exceptional Sicilian food at <a href="http://houston.citysearch.com/profile/9903101/houston_tx/arcodoro.html">Arcodoro</a> and excellent American at <a href="http://houston.citysearch.com/profile/41944291/houston_tx/pic_restaurant.html">Pic</a>. There was reasonably authentic Vietnamese at <a href="http://houston.citysearch.com/profile/11359310/houston_tx/vietopia_vietnamese_cuisine.html">Vietopia</a>,  a pretty good dinner at the hotel&#8217;s restaurant, <a href="http://houston.citysearch.com/profile/9863855/houston_tx/olivette_at_the_houstonian.html">Olivette</a>. Heck, we even did well at <a href="http://houston.citysearch.com/profile/41940538/houston_tx/escalante_s_mexican_grille.html">Escalante</a>, and our old standard <a href="http://houston.citysearch.com/profile/9868857/houston_tx/the_state_grille.html">The State Grille</a>. But maybe the best find &#8212; and my downfall tonight &#8212; was at light-Indian <a href="http://houston.citysearch.com/profile/9868851/houston_tx/kiran_s.html">Kiran&#8217;s</a>.</p>

<p>I had a stewed lamb with three kinds of peppers. My father had an incredible, cardamom-y, spicy-but-not-too-spicy Vindaloo. My mother had maybe the best Tandoori lamb I&#8217;ve ever had. We started with a fried onion that showed how unawesome the Awesome Blossom actually is. The portions were massive, and I stuffed my face with them. And then it hurt to just walk to the car. Now it hurts to sit here an type. I think I&#8217;m going to lie down and take some pressure off my innards. After all, I&#8217;ve got to rest up for <a href="http://houston.citysearch.com/profile/41743389/houston_tx/tony_s.html">tomorrow&#8217;s overindulgence</a>. Peace.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003031.html#fn3">3</a></sup></p>
