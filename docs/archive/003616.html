				<p>The regularly-updated content I promised here on Juniorbird.com? Well, here&#8217;s part 1 of the complete calendar: a monthly fun drink that you can join me in boozing it up with! This month&#8217;s drink is the Rob Roy &#8212; a version of the Manhattan made with Scotch. (A Manhattan is basically a Martini, but with whiskey, traditionally Rye.) A Manhattan should be sweeter, richer, and more flavorful than the dry, understated Martini; the Rob Roy adds on to that Scotch&#8217;s traditional peaty flavors.</p>

<p>So why&#8217;d I pick the Rob Roy? Well, first of all, I love Martinis, but sometimes one wants to go a bit afield. Also, I wanted to make sure that &#8212; as is a requirement for all the drinks in this series &#8212; the ingredients are fairly easy-to-find; let&#8217;s face it, I don&#8217;t enjoy rooting around for rare liqueurs, and it&#8217;s more fun to make drinks that my friends can share in anyway.</p>

<p>And I wanted to have a whiskey.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003616.html#fn1">1</a></sup> Since I&#8217;m allergic to corn, this means that blended whiskeys and all Bourbons are verboten for me. Single malts on the other hand, are safe; Irish whiskeys are usually blended, so this really leaves Scotch.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003616.html#fn2">2</a></sup> I found a couple of affordable single-malts and determined to see what I could do with them.</p>

<p>Scotch #1 is <a href="http://www.bevmo.com/productinfo.asp?sku=00000002173">Lismore Single Malt</a>. From the Speyside region, whence comes most Scotch, this is a pretty accessible beverage when drunk neat, with just a little peat and an overall sweet, caramel-y<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003616.html#fn3">3</a></sup> taste. Scotch #2, <a href="http://www.vintagemaltwhisky.com/product-finlaggan.html">Finlaggan</a>, is an Islay single malt; Islay Scotches are typically the peatiest of the Scotches, and Finlaggan didn&#8217;t disappoint, with a tremendous peaty, smoky flavor that was much more challenging when drunk neat. Of course, the real test was the Rob Roy. </p>

<p><img src="/images/dotm/robroy.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>A Rob Roy typically contains a 2.5:1 or 3:1 mix of Scotch to Vermouth, with a few shots of bitters to round it out. I found that the Speyside worked much better with Dry Vermouth and Angostura bitters, and the Islay with Sweet Vermouth and Fey&#8217;s bitters, which are a bit sweeter than the Angosturas. I substantially preferred the flavor of the Finlaggan Islay single malt, which had more flavor, as well as a rounder taste. Overall, I&#8217;d definitely drink a Rob Roy on a regular basis; it&#8217;s not as refreshing as a Martini, but it&#8217;s delicious, matches well with food, and provides access to a whole new set of flavors. I&#8217;ve found that most bartenders know the Rob Roy, so this is a drink I could order out, too; I&#8217;ll have to learn the names of a few common Islay single malts so I can get a Rob Roy with my choice of call liquor.</p>


<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Or, as the Scots spell it, &#8220;whisky.&#8221;  </p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> There are a small number of all-rye American Ryes, but these challenge my &#8220;easy-to-find&#8221; rule. For people who can tolerate corn, the Jim Beam Rye, which is pretty common, is supposed to make a good Manhattan.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn3"><sup>3</sup> I&#8217;m told that the proper term for whisky-philes is &#8220;toffee.&#8221;</p>

                    <p>Laphroaig 10 year is good and 15 year is better, from islay.  Oban 14 year is good, from west highland. I like the Glenlivet 18 yr-speyside, and Macallan 18 yr-highland. Come into Ocean and Vine at the Loews Hotel and I&#8217;ll serve you a scotch sampler.. or a Robroy Manhattan of your choice scotch..  not recommended for people 90 and over</p>
