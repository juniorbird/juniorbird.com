<p>Ahh, Thanksgiving, when others cook so that I may overeat massively. There&#8217;s no other holiday like it! Of course, everybody does their bit, and, this year, my bit was making green beans and gravy.</p>
				
				<p>Both are an every-year event. The beans are a recipe I inherited from a college friend, are easy to make and taste just a litte out-of-the-ordinary &#8212; which they should, since it&#8217;s actually a basque recipe. The best part about these beans is that they&#8217;re basically impossible to either overcook <strong>or</strong> undercook. Here&#8217;s the recipe:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Lecas</strong><br />
1 lb. fresh green beans, trimmed &amp; cut into 1&#8221; lengths<br />
1/4 C olive oil<br />
2 cloves garlic, minced<br />
1 large onion, chopped<br />
2 lbs. chopped tomatoes (peeled is better but unpeeled is fine)<br />
salt, pepper and oregano to taste</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet or dutch oven; saut&eacute; the onions and garlic in it until they begin to color. Add the chopped tomatoes, with all their juice, and simmer.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Immerse the beans in heavily-salted boiling water for 5 minutes, then cool under cold running water. Add them to the tomato sauce and add water to barely cover the beans. Add salt and pepper and simmer, covered, for 30 minutes.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Uncover, cook down sauce for 10 minutes, add oregano, stir and serve.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now, the gravy is also an every-year dish. But it&#8217;s a different kind of every-year dish &#8212; it&#8217;s the kind of dish that goes wrong, in a different way, every year.  This year I&#8217;d decided that I&#8217;d try this technique I&#8217;d read about in some obscure book somewhere: thicken gravy with pureed giblets. I think I learned about this approach sometime during my saucier phase, during which I wanted nothing more than to learn to perfect every sauce I could &#8212; but that was before I learned how wonderful a simple roast is (not that a nice pan gravy or jus doesn&#8217;t help out that roast&#8230; mmm&#8230;).</p>

<p>Finally, this year, we had a lot of extra giblets:<br />
<img src="/images/thanksgiving/kidneys.jpg" alt="kidneys, cut up, and a knife" />
So I stuck them in the Cuisinart with some oil and made a nice fine puree. Then I added that to stock and got&#8230; meatballs. Vigorous whisking broke up the meatballs but didn&#8217;t thicken the stock much; finally I broke down and made a roux, which thickened things right up:<br />

<p>A bit more mundane than I&#8217;d hope, but what counts is the eatin&#8217;. And eat I did:<br />

<p>When I recover from that, I&#8217;ll make stock from the turkey carcass and see what fun things I can do with leftovers.</p>
