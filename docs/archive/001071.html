				<p>In what can only be interpreted as an attempt to further establish my geek cred, I have to say that, far and away, my favorite TV show of the new season is <a href="http://scifi.com/battlestar/">Battlestar Galactica</a>. Not only has BG gained &#8220;keep until I delete&#8221; status on my TiVo, I have a seriously hard time waiting until next friday for the next episode. I need my fix, man!</p>

<p>The show&#8217;s got three things going for it:</p>


<ul>
<li>Concept</li>
<li>Writing</li>
<li>Acting</li>
</ul>



<p>Effects are, as with most cable series, &#8220;plenty good enough&#8221; (CGI has come so far). But it&#8217;s the other parts that make BG stand out. The concept is a fresh, dark, current re-thnking of the original series. Although I think there are a few things from the old show that have been lost &#8212; the silly mechanical Cylons, Socialators, and a hundreds-of-years-old Galactica among them &#8212; the new &#8220;world&#8221; is a solid foundation for future seasons.</p>

<p>The writing is also great. The chief writer has credits including <span class="caps">HBO&#8217;</span>s Carnivale, and he writes great, complicated, dark scripts. Everyone has real weaknesses and real motives. Plots hold together over multiple episodes and little things become important later.</p>

<p>And the actors are great. A real standout is the girl (!) who plays Starbuck, but there&#8217;s nobody weak in the whole show. Rare on cable, but great. I seriously can&#8217;t wait for next week.</p>

<p>Speaking of real, yes, there&#8217;s a reality show that&#8217;s easily the best of the new season. That show is Nanny 911. Reality can be crass and exploitative &#8212; and this show is both &#8212; but Nanny 911 also educates. We see an all-star team of British nannies teach simple lessons like &#8220;how to tell your children &#8216;no&#8217;&#8221;, &#8220;how to discipline consistently&#8221;, &#8220;how to communicate&#8221;, etc. Real people with real families with real problems can really learn from this show. Watch it too.</p>

<p>Next entry: why I don&#8217;t actually have time to watch either of these programs.</p>
