				<p>When I was in Brazil, I frequently was <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/001535.html">stuck sitting in the front seat of cabs</a>. For some strange reason, even though the cabs were tiny, even though all of them had some major instrument out of service (speedometer, fuel, or, in one case a functional-but-not-useful generic turn indicator that flashed a two-headed arrow whenever the driver signalled), even though the cabs were all driven at a high rate of speed, even though the cabs followed too close, didn&#8217;t attend to the lanes painted on the road, and even though the cabs just blew through red lights after dark, I never was particularly scared. And, yes, I took the cabs before I got drinking too. But, today, taking a cab from the Mexico City airport to <a href="http://www.caminoreal.com/">my hotel</a>. I was scared out of my gourd. Clutching the hanging front-seat seatbelt for dear life. Staring at my feet so that I didn&#8217;t have to look out the window at my onrushing doom.</p>

<p>I have no idea why I took it so bad. The driver was only doing 100 (km/h), the traffic wasn&#8217;t bad, he wasn&#8217;t driving crazy, I just felt unsafe. So I started to think about how I might say &#8220;hey, can you slow down?&#8221; in Spanish. This was hard because, try as I might, my Spanish just hasn&#8217;t been working today &#8212; while the flight attendant on the airplane spoke to me in Spanish, everyone else marked me for English straight away.  I didn&#8217;t think that, after only a few weeks away from Chile, my newfound Spanish comfort level would have disappeared already. But it had; I couldn&#8217;t even remember &#8220;slower&#8221;.</p>

<p>Then, rushing around a soft curve at a high rate of speed, it came to me: &#8220;lentamente&#8221;. And then I decided to think of meaner things to say &#8212; and, best of all I could think of the words! Out of my fear apparently came some ability to speak Spanish again. Thanks, cab driver!</p>

<p>Of course, I&#8217;m still not at 100%. The guy who brought my room service asked me &#8220;todo bien?&#8221; and I responded &#8220;sim, muito bem.&#8221; Perhaps tomorrow we&#8217;ll discover how far I can get in Mexico City while speaking extremely poor Portuguese.</p>
