				<p>In the very back of my house, above the closet in my office, I have a rather deep shelf with a narrow sliding door. Over the years, I&#8217;ve managed to fill this shelf with one forgotten thing after another; naturally, the stuff that I wanted to keep all ended up sitting on the floor or in other temporary locations. But, with a 3-day weekend under my belt, I actually cleaned out the shelf. Oh, the crap that I threw away. But some of it: not so bad. Like, for instance, this:</p>

<p><img src="/images/eosrebels.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>That&#8217;s the camera I had in <em>high school</em>, the <a href="http://photonotes.org/manuals/eos-rebel-s-ii/">Canon <span class="caps">EOS</span> Rebel S</a>, a very early entry-level <span class="caps">EOS </span>body. It was actually tucked away in a very old camera bag, hidden beneath a old and exceedingly mediocre digital camera that I had inherited back in &#8216;99 and whose breathtaking lack of features and poor resolution contributed materially to my decision to give up photography as a hobby.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003659.html#fn1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>In today&#8217;s market, the Rebel S body is almost stunning for how simple it is &#8212; in fact, I think it has about the smallest number of doo-dads that you can put in an <span class="caps">SLR </span>and have any advantage over a point-and-shoot. There&#8217;s no drive selection<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003659.html#fn2">2</a></sup>, only the one metering mode,<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003659.html#fn3">3</a></sup> no multi-point autofocus selection (it only focuses on vertical lines! how quaint!) &#8212; just full-manual, aperture priority, shutter priority, and full-auto. Oh, sure, there are programmed modes, but who uses those? I guess they were an innovative idea when the camera came out, even if those same modes do now exist on every entry-level point-and-shoot.</p>

<p>The non-simple thing about the camera is figuring out if it works. With a digital camera, you take it out, see if it turns on, if not, put in a new battery, take a photo, and it works or not. With a film camera &#8212; well, I&#8217;ll tell you if it works when I get the film developed. But it did need a new battery. Still, it&#8217;s a good sign that everything worked once I put said battery in.</p>

<p>By a stunning coincidence &#8212; and totally without any planning<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003659.html#fn4">4</a></sup> &#8212; this body is actually compatible with the same lenses I have for my digital <span class="caps">SLR, </span>an <span class="caps">EOS</span> Rebel XTi. Which means I now have a film body! Which perhaps means that I can take all that film I bought for my sadly-stolen Minolta system out of the butter shelf in my fridge, shoot it, and put my butter back where it belongs.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s how you, too, can clean out your fridge by cleaning out your back shelf.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> In all fairness, I must give plenty of credit to <a href="http://www.art.pomona.edu/studioart/faculty/pinkel.html">Sheila Pinkel</a> for this as well.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> That is, how many frames the camera shoots every time you click the button.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn3"><sup>3</sup> What method the camera uses to figure out how bright the photo you&#8217;re trying to take is, and therefore what the exposure it suggests to you should be &#8212; does the camera measure only the item you&#8217;re focusing on? Some subset of items that appear to be highlights? Take an average of the whole scene? On my <span class="caps">DSLR,</span> I can choose.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn4"><sup>4</sup> Technically there may have been a bit of reverse planning. I got used to the Canon interface on my <span class="caps">EOS</span> Rebel in high school and a bit in college. The later Minolta bodies I used were an easy switch for me because (from what I have read), back in the late &#8217;60s, Minolta ripped off Canon&#8217;s interface; while the two have diverged since then, the philosophy remains the same. So, it&#8217;s much easier for me to go back and forth between Minoltas and Canons than it is for me to use totally unfamiliar Nikons and Canons.</p>

<p>Alternately, you could move, which requires cleaning both and tossing out stuff that&#8217;s fossilized in either location&#8230;  Though in that case, correlation does not imply causation.</p>

                    <p>Aside from the fact that moving is a morbid undertaking, I think (for whatever my two cents is worth) that you&#8217;re right to stay in your place for at least six months: Your back door works, parking IS looking up - or will the addition of my five iron, summer&#8217;s around the corner and you&#8217;ve got your great back-yard setup, and the price is certainly right. Plus, it doesn&#8217;t make sense to uproot yourself until all gold-fish quality control and similar issues are well in hand. All well worth the months-long wait.    </p>

<p>After this morning&#8217;s catastrophe, I&#8217;ve decided to embrace Bing Crosby&#8217;s philosophy and &#8220;accentuate the positive//eliminate the negative..&#8221; </p>

                    <p>Yes, I&#8217;m not sure that either of us is allowed to move into a nicer place until we&#8217;ve proven we won&#8217;t burn it down or something!</p>

<p>That was a spooky dream, tho. I could totally feel the pouch with my Dine to Thrive meal in it wiggle as the goldfish swam around! What a bizarre dream, huh? At least I can be sure that we will never have that particular quality control problem.</p>
