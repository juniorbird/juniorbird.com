				<p>Everyone says that you need to spend time on New Zealand&#8217;s famous sounds, Milford Sound and Doubtful Sound (both of which are, in fact, fjords rather than sounds). Doubtful Sound is the more remote, difficult, and vast destination; of course, we had to go there. Of course, that meant more driving. But, fortunately, at the end of this drive was a boat, taking us through an overnight cruise far, far away from pretty much anything else in this world.</p>

<p><iframe width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=doubtful+sound,+new+zealand&amp;sll=-45.564132,167.614981&amp;sspn=4.438127,9.415283&amp;dirflg=w&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Doubtful+Sound&amp;ll=-44.166445,169.145508&amp;spn=5.516366,9.338379&amp;z=6&amp;output=embed"></iframe></p>

<p>Sure, there was a quick bus ride first, and that after a fast catamaran across Lake Manapouri, which is supposed to be one of New Zealand&#8217;s most beautiful lakes. I was too impatient to see our final destination to pay attention, but when the bus crested the mountain to head down New Zealand&#8217;s steepest road into Doubtful Sound, and the fjord suddenly broke through the foliage, I knew we were in for quite an adventure.</p>

<p>At the base of said steepest road was our ship, the <a href="http://www.realjourneys.co.nz/Main/DoubtfulSoundOvernightCruise/">Fiordland Navigator</a>. They greeted us with hot soup and we brought our bags into our little stateroom.</p>

<p>We set out into the mist and rain of the Sound. This was easily the coldest place we&#8217;d been so far, but at least with an excuse this time &#8212; Doubtful Sound is far, far south, and so remote. Which was the whole point. Whipping wind and fine mist of rain and fog and  white-capped waves and all that.</p>

<p>The captain even took us out into the storm-tossed Tasman Sea. Waves broke over the bow of the ship, we rolled back and forth, and I staggered from one end of the forward deck to the next, trying to hold still long enough to actually get a shot off.</p>

<p>Dinner was delicious, with three salads, four starches, and delicious smoked salmon and roast beef and lamb, and even a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavlova_">Pavlova</a>(food) for dessert. And then we fell straight asleep in the quiet dark night. The next day, before we docked, the Captain let Mrs. DJ L&#8217;il Bit drive the boat.</p>

<p>And then we drove to Queenstown, to finally park the car for good.</p>
