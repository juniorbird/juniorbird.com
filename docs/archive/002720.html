				<p>While hearing about the latest round of foiled terrorists and new flight security restrictions, all I&#8217;ve been able to think is &#8220;thank goodness I didn&#8217;t have to fly across the Pacific without my iPod, water, and hand lotion!&#8221; I realize this makes me a complete boor.</p>

<p>I guess I should qualify that statement &#8212; I would have gone insane flying American Airlines to Hawaii without my book and water and hand cream and iPod. Heck, they even charged for the in-flight meals on that trip. But on my long trip to and from Bangkok, taking <a href="http://www.china-airlines.com/en/index.htm">China Airlines</a>, I was actually pretty well taken care of. I had two meals on each flight, both pretty tasty (admittedly, I&#8217;m a bad judge of how good an Asian meal really is, but I would not have hated them in an inexpensive restaurant in America). There was moisturizer in the bathroom, so I didn&#8217;t have to sit there and dessicate in the dry cabin air. There was even a personal entertainment system in the back of the seat in front of me, so I coud listen to the latest Asian hit music, watch any of two dozen movies, or play a variety of games on a PlayStation-style controller (I should note that the interface for this system was hardly good &#8212; I had to show the kid next to me how to use it, and another seatmate had to guess that a button labeled &#8220;Language&#8221; would switch him from English, which he clearly could not read, to a Chinese-language interface). China Airlines even had tea and Cup o&#8217; Noodles available at all times &#8212; and, when I got upgraded to business class on my Bangkok-Taipei leg heading home, free wireless internet.</p>

<p>How can American, or any other cost-cutting US airline, survive in a world of no carry-on baggage, especially against international competition like this? I might accept a few hours of boredom for a Southwest-style fare, but you&#8217;d better believe that, if I&#8217;m paying $hundreds for my flight, even even-tempered ol&#8217; me is going to go ballistic if I have to pay for every drink. But can airlines suddenly charge more to cover food costs? Hardly, in these air-travel-as-a-commodity times &#8212; and that doesn&#8217;t even consider how much airlines would need to take in to cover the cost of offering an in-seat entertainment system.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think people will fly and be bored. People will save money and go for Southwest, or spend just a little more and enjoy their JetBlue DirecTV, or fly a European or Asian carrier that can offer a full-service experience, either because they don&#8217;t need to make a profit or because they have the low cost structure that comes from being based in a developing nation. Where&#8217;s the room in between for an expensive, boring travel experience?</p>

<p>I&#8217;d love to see how our domestic carriers get out of this one. It&#8217;s a doozy, but it&#8217;s just been one kick in the jewels after another for them since 9/11. I don&#8217;t think the terrorists can ever beat us, but it may be that they can beat our air travel industry. Until then, I guess I&#8217;m taking Amtrak.</p>

                    <p>This is so ridiculous&#8230; &#8220;terrorists&#8221; &#8212; even today, even after my wife was a couple blocks from the WTC &#8212; still don&#8217;t make my top 1000 of things that scare me.  Why do Americans let themselves get played like a fiddle?  Over and over again.  It must be the stellar education system.  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/g5d9o" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/g5d9o</a></p>

<p>Word.</p>

<p>I do not think it is good for the human soul to sit with boredom for hours on end. In fact, I believe it qualifies as torture, something human bodies can stand but shouldn&#8217;t have to.</p>

                    <p>As if they hadn&#8217;t already spent enough effort turning our schools into places where we&#8217;re forced to sit still for hours on end and be bored &#8212; as preparation for being good little worker drones &#8212; now they need to re-condition us as adults.  I guess too many affluent, bicoastal frequent-flyers were starting to get the idea that the government should be answerable to its people&#8230; :-P</p>
