							<p>I like to cook. You may have <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_food.html">read</a>. Any chef loves their gadgets, and, being a geek, I do so more than most. While I do tend to think that the solution to almost any problem is technology, I don&#8217;t like to keep things around that don&#8217;t really, really work. Since it&#8217;s the holiday season, and that means getting stuff for both of the major world religions of which I am a member, here are a few such gadgets I suggest you put on your wish list this year. For your online shopping convenience, I&#8217;ve included links to buy all these goodies at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F&amp;tag=wadearmstrong-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Amazon</a>, which incidentally gives a smidge of the price of your purchase to me, at no cost to you.

I&#8217;ve been without my music since I came to Houston, although, technically, that&#8217;s only because I&#8217;m too stubborn to listen to Pandora without my good speakers plugged in.

							<p>The <span class="caps">AIG </span>and I went to a Haunted House last weekend. It was kind of a lark &#8212; we were having a night on the town, walking down the street, and there was an empty ticket line for a haunted house. Seemed rather season-appropriate, so we went in. And then the <span class="caps">AIG </span>shivered in anticipated fear as we made our way to the head of the line to get in, and screamed her way through the (admittedly very well-done) haunted house. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003539.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>For some reason, very few things make a home look bad to me as a fridge whose light has burnt out. To me, it says &#8220;I just don&#8217;t care about having a pleasant, maintained place to live.&#8221; I mean, you go into the fridge several times every day, right? So it&#8217;s not like you can avoid noticing it.</p>

<p>Of course, with an attitude like that, my fridge light would burn out. For the last week, I&#8217;ve had a nice, ghetto kitchen with a darkened fridge. Tr&egrave;s Palms. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003401.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>About a month ago, my desk lamp in my office quit working. I figured it burnt out, so I changed the lightbulb, but there was no more light with the new bulb than with the old. Sadly, I classified my &#8217;50s-style lamp as dead. Then, today, the light in my kitchen went out. I replaced the bulb but: nothing. So I washed the dishes in the dark, and vowed to call the landlord tomorrow, when he was in the office. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003348.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I&#8217;m an inveterate entrepreneur; I like coming up with new, crazy ideas and turning them into cool companies. Or, well, I will like someday when I&#8217;ve done it successfully. Anyway, I was a poli sci major as an undergrad, so sometimes I wonder: why is it that we don&#8217;t have any truly new and innovative approaches to how a company should work? I mean, there are plenty of countries out there that are, for all practical purposes, completely fucked. So why shouldn&#8217;t they try something crazy? Here it is then, two crazy ideas of models failed countries can try. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003009.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Is there any time that seems later than mid-evening on Thanksgiving Day? Belly full of turkey, bloodstream full of tryptophan, the dark night outside empty and still as families sit together and share plates piled high with heirloom recipies, it could be 6 or 8 or even 2 am. It&#8217;s a good time to think about the year behind and the year ahead, and to give thanks for what went well and what we dream will go even better. Unfortunately, I&#8217;m an ungrateful bastard. Another year is almost gone, there have been good times and bad, but ahead I see an unfinished journey and I can&#8217;t bring myself to be thankful for that. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002938.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>For some reason I don&#8217;t fully understand, every time I go to my neighborhood McDonald&#8217;s, there&#8217;s some methampehtamine addict waiting in line for a vanilla cone. Is it that vanilla cones are the outside equivalent of cigarettes in the joint, a convenient medium of trade in the absence of cash? Apart from the presence of cash on the outside, that is? Are McDonald&#8217;s cones a good substitute for Tylenol, now that Tylenol is a controlled substance? Is there something special in the vanilla cone itself? If so, can just anyone get a special cone, or does one have to be visibly tweaking to get the &#8220;special dip&#8221;? Either way, I&#8217;m allergic to milk, so I&#8217;ll never find out. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002864.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>When I was in high school I took a class in creative writing; at the end of the semester, I held in my hands a forty-some page computer printout of some many-times-revised writing achievement, ready for submission to some writing competition for high school students. My story, of course (coming as it did from a freshman in high school), was macabre, and, worse, it was written in a run-on style that sat somewhere between Faulkner and Sweet Valley High with all of the punctuation removed. I was proud, but, when I read my friend Blaise&#8217;s submission to that same competition his simple, clear sentences made me put aside any thought of my story receiving awards. I tried, later, to write using plainer language and clearer themes, and briefly fancied myself as having some skill; but then a new student came to my school. Jess wrote ethereal prose, each sentence stripped down to the fewest words possible, hinting only obliquely at conversation or exposition, sort of like some Zen koan from whose hidden meaning we should understand the world. I couldn&#8217;t approach Jess&#8217;s writing, and, after a few feeble attempts, I took another creative writing class and turned out a baroque and bloody term paper story that sported a sentence all of a page and a half long. It didn&#8217;t help that I was reading Joyce at the time. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002705.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>For the past two years, I&#8217;ve jealously guarded my weekends &#8212; guarded them from, you know, people and other similar time sucks that expect my interactive attention. And it was great. One, maybe two nights a week I&#8217;d have enough free time that I could spend it on me. You know, watch Cops, read a book, ogle attractive women, things like that, and never a second wheel to distract me from my entirely non-interactive me time.<br />

							<p>Last night I was out with some friends; we ended up at a divey sports bar in Santa Monica. To put it briefly, it sucked, and we wanted to go across the street to a cooler bar, but one of my friends had just gotten herself a nice cool bottle of Corona. Since she was too much of a pussy to chug the beer, she stuck her beer in my chest pocket and started to prod me to smuggle her beer into the new bar. Then my other friend joined in, and how could I resist two women daring me to do a bad bad thing? So I closed my jacket over the beer and we walked across the street. I played it cool and we slipped right past the doorman and into the dance floor in the back, where I slipped out my friend&#8217;s beer and she nursed it for another 20 minutes. I&#8217;m a bad man. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002580.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>The timestamp attached to this post is a bit deceptive; I&#8217;ve actually been up since 5am. And that&#8217;s how my week&#8217;s been, folks, with the same story for the week before. It&#8217;s not generic <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000047.php">morningsomonia</a>, and it&#8217;s not, remarkably, a generic worry about how much I have to get done. Instead, I&#8217;ve woken up early thinking <em>specific</em> thoughts about <em>specific</em> projects, consumed by <em>specific</em> worries about <em>specific</em> deliverables. Which sucks, because, let&#8217;s face it, when you wake up at 5am and realize that Godiva Chocolates might be a good comparable for doing a valuation of Peet&#8217;s Coffee, there&#8217;s nothing that will get that idea out of your head other than logging onto <a href="http://www.onesource.com/">OneSource</a> and grabbing Godiva&#8217;s financials. And, when you discover that Godiva is really a subsidiary of Campbell&#8217;s Soup, well, there&#8217;s no getting back to sleep. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002086.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

I like the good stuff, and I&#8217;ll spend on it (something which various of my hairstylists have loved, I&#8217;m sure). Usually, I go for some relatively cutting-edge product, then move on to the next cutting-edge product when the first one becomes hard to find anywhere outside of Sally Beauty Supply. But now it&#8217;s different. Now I look fabulous and I do it with product I got at Target &#8212; and at Target prices. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001881.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>There&#8217;s an old joke about Texas: A Texan plays poker with the Devil. The game goes on day after day, week after week, and the stakes get bigger and bigger the whole time. One day, the Texan calls Satan&#8217;s big bet with the deed to all of Texas, whereupon the Devil throws down his royal flush, busting the Texan broke. The Texan gets ready to pack his things and move, but then the Devil disappears down a deep hole back to Hell. &#8220;Hey Satan,&#8221; yells the Texan, &#8220;aren&#8217;t you going to take my state?&#8221; &#8220;No,&#8221; replies the Devil, &#8220;I&#8217;ve spent a few weeks in Texas and, believe me, I&#8217;ve decided to live in Hell and rent out Texas.&#8221; Have I mentioned lately that I&#8217;m living in Phoenix for the summer?

							<h3>Arizona: Dangerous For Interns, Temporary Relocation</h3>

							<p>Are you thinking of a summer internship or temporary relocation to Arizona? Think twice, it&#8217;s dangerous. Interns and others who choose to temporarily relocate to Arizona may have to register their car in the state or be heavily fined. Even though interns and other temporary workers will only be in the state for a few weeks or months, and even though interns and other temporary workers may not qualify as residents, the police may still think you are a new resident of Arizona and may still ticket you. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001587.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

For three years, I was part-owner of a Web and print design studio; during that time, I did (among other things) back-end development for Web sites. I learned, and taught others, how to write code on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listserv">listservs</a>, and, for many years, a search for &#8220;Wade Armstrong&#8221; on Google would show up my many posts.

Now, before I went to Brazil I didn&#8217;t have a particular tendency to drink coffee &#8212; I prefer tea &#8212; but, when I got home, I started wanting some all the time. For the past few weeks, I&#8217;ve been drinking coffee on and off, in the hopes of finding some that compares to what I drank in S&atilde;o Paulo and Rio.
