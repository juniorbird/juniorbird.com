							<h3>Just Call Me the Battleship Maine</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov  2, 2011 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_dreams.html">Dreams</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever started a war in my dreams beforeâ€¦ but there&#8217;s always a first. See, me and my friends, while we were just ten or eleven or&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/004134.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p class="date">Aug  3, 2011 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_dreams.html">Dreams</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Weird dream last night: I traveled to North Korea on some state-sponsored tour, and got to meet Kim Jong Il. He was actually a real nice guy! Later, I put&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/004113.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>High-Stakes Quickfire Challenge</h3>
							<p class="date">Sep 20, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_dreams.html">Dreams</a></p>
						    	
							<p>The <em>Top Chef</em> of your dreams may involve outrageous ingredients, inspired chefs, and aggressive, coolly-confident characters; mine apparently involves chefs marooned in space. In my dream <em>Top Chef</em>, the contestants, Tom Colicchio, Padma Lakshmi, and me, were all sent out to a far-away planet, along with a shipful of miners and farmers and builders, to establish a new colony (Gail Simmons had her own ship and went back to Earth between episodes). The winning chef would be the head chef at a brand-new luxury resort on a distant continent; the losing chefs would all be sent off, together, to colonize another planet.  <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003833.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Boy, Seth Rogen's in a Lot Lately!</h3>
							<p class="date">Apr 13, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_dreams.html">Dreams</a></p>
						    	
							<p>My gig was watching Jonah Hill. From a distance, that is; I was in hidden surveillance. He hung out at an intersection in the city, with a brownstone at one corner, an art deco skyscraper at the next, a small copse of bamboo &#8212; in which I&#8217;d encamped myself &#8212; opposite from the brownstone, and a white brick industrial building at the other. At the bottom floor of the skyscraper were the comic book store and sub shop Jonah liked to hang out at. He was talking to Seth Rogen, who stood on a black metal balcony on the second floor o the white brick industrial building. I couldn&#8217;t hear them but I could see the laughs. I could also see Seth startle, stand straight up, and point as the four ninjas swooped out of the shadows and snatched poor Jonah. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003817.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Whipping Gretzky</h3>
							<p class="date">Feb 24, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_dreams.html">Dreams</a></p>
						    	
							<p>We were playing a three-way game of hockey &#8212; us, the Finnish national team, and the Swedish national team, that is. With only two ends to the ice, we&#8217;d switch one team out when enough goals were scored against them. Except those darned Swedes never seemed to get scored on &#8212; they had their strategy down, and Wayne Gretzky in goal. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003805.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Starring Michael Cera and Ellen Page</h3>
							<p class="date">Sep 18, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_dreams.html">Dreams</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Michael Cera&#8217;s character runs cross-country; he&#8217;s counting on his coach to get him a college scholarship. It&#8217;s a good thing that his coach is having a big recruiting day for all the area cross-country standouts on Thursday &#8212; all the college scouts will be watching! Or at least that&#8217;s what Mikey<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003721.html#fn1">1</a></sup> thinks, the coach is actually a charlatan. With that great slack-jawed look that Cera can do, Mikey discovers that he needs to fill the event with some kind of ringers, or the scouts will be pissed off and not give him a chance. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003721.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Best Renew The Library Books</h3>
							<p class="date">Mar 31, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_dreams.html">Dreams</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Waiting in line to check out my new book, I realized I&#8217;d forgotten to bring back the overdue book that I owed. Checking in my pocket, I only had a few Mexican coins &#8212; two large five-peso coins, a small three-peso coin, two tiny two-peso coins, and a medum-sized one peso coin. She&#8217;d take them.<br />

							<h3>And This Just In: Generalissimo Francisco Franco is Still Dead</h3>
							<p class="date">Mar 12, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_dreams.html">Dreams</a></p>
						    	
							<p>We &#8212; that is, myself, the various madly-retreating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franquism">Spanish Nationalist</a> troops with which I was traveling, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franquism">Generalissimo Francisco Franco</a> &#8212; were trudging through a lightly-forested area of gently rolling and quite verdant hills. The sky was clear and the sun bright, but we didn&#8217;t expect the three Republican fighters that appeared in the distance, charging towards us. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003665.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>The night Rick died, his ex called me in the middle of the night to tell me. But her voicemail was unintelligible; and I was already up. I&#8217;d been up for an hour, and I&#8217;d spent that whole time in terror. Because I was sure he was coming to get me.<br />

							<p>My third cat, Percy, we got from a farm in Western Maryland when I was in 7th grade. Out of a barn or not, Percy looked like an <a href="http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/abyssinian.html">Abyssinan</a> with the coat of a <a href="http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/russian.html">Russian Blue</a>. When we first got him, I held Percy on my lap as we drove him home; he sat bolt upright and peered out the window for the whole trip. About 20 minutes in, he peed on me, the good, solid, sustained pee that comes from holding it in for a while and then finally letting go when you need to. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002999.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Intergalactic Colonization</h3>

							<p>Humans had gone to the stars, filled with hope, and colonized one planet, many light-years away from Earth. But, as we entered the universe, we made enemies, and one of these enemies attacked earth and rendered it uninhabitable. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001748.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>While on the campaign trail, I thought I would take a break and see an <a href="http://http://www.tayshaurquhart.com/Blog/">old friend</a> for dinner. My car drove me and my chief of staff along the 1, up the curves of the coast, to a restaurant on the top of a small rise overlooking the Pacific. Inside, we ate a grand gourmet repast. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001555.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I am on the starship Enterprise, from the Next Generation TV show (a fine show, even if certain people think it&#8217;s boring). We find a spaceship (is it an alternative&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000891.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Somehow, I&#8217;ve managed to miss everybody&#8217;s favorite new movie, The Passion of the Christ. I actually considered seeing it over the weekend, but, instead, I ended up seeing &#8220;Goodbye Lenin&#8221;&#8230;. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000405.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
