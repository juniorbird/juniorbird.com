				<p>I had to make a visit to the doctor&#8217;s office, so I climbed the stairs to the fourth floor of the building. I&#8217;d been to this office before, and I hated going &#8212; at the top of the stairs was a railing, and I had to climb over this railing and walk along a thin ledge jutting out next to a four-story drop in order to get to the hallway the doctor&#8217;s office was on. When I got to the top several people were climbing over the rail to go to the doctor, but I suddenly became very scared as I approched the railing. A nice blonde technician in scrubs said that many people become scared climbing over this railing and helped me get to the office.</p>

<p>After I left the office, I ran into my mother &#8212; who also saw the same doctor &#8212; in the waiting room, and we left together. She planned to take the elevator down, so we walked  to the elevator which was just down the hall. There was a small hatch in the wall leading to a small shaft in which an elevator barely large enough for two must have traveled. I was apprehensive about taking this elevator and proposed using the stairs, but my mother assured me that the elevator was <span class="caps">OK.</span> The man in line ahead of us opened the door to the elevator shaft and reached in &#8212; I told him to watch his hand because the car might be coming. He shot me an odd look with his head cocked to the side, then pushed a button inside the shaft. A large platform rose through a hole in the floor and my mother and the man stepped on. I joined them, and the platform began to descend. It turned out that my mother had worked with the man, who was a lawyer, in the past; they talked about stories of the case they had collaborated on.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the elevator gave a lurch and the platform tipped sideways. The man was undisturbed, but I had to grab the floor to keep from falling. I yelled to my mother to hold on, but she fell into the shaft. We were only about a story down, so I feared she&#8217;d died in the three-story plunge. The man was totally unperturbed. I frantically asked him if he thought my mother would be ok, and he said yes; then, up the shaft came her voice: &#8220;I&#8217;m ok!&#8221;.</p>

<p>Then we reached the first floor.</p>
