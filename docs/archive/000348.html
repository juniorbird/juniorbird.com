				<p>For some reason, business schools seem to actually want proof that I&#8217;ve gained academic success in the past, so I&#8217;ve ordered transcripts from all two of the colleges I&#8217;ve attended. The transcripts tell a lot about me, but they also tell a lot about the schools.</p>
				
				<p>Had I it all to do again, I would order the transcripts early. Very early. After all, this is a part of the process that is entirely out of my control, so it&#8217;s kind of nerve-wracking to not have the transcripts in my hand. And I&#8217;m a bit concerned that, should there be any problems with the transcripts, there won&#8217;t be time to deal with that. But this is the order in which I prioritized all of the application-related activities I have to do, and I still believe it&#8217;s the best order I could have chosen given the demands upon my time.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s not the interesting part of the transcripts; the interesting part is how much they cost. I paid $20 for each of the six copies (five for my schools, one for me to look at to make sure everything is ok) of my <a href="http://ucla.edu"><span class="caps">UCLA</span></a> transcript from three classes I took in the summer of 1995, with turnaround promised within a week or so or maybe ten days. And then I paid $0 each for the six copies of my <a href="http://pomona.edu">Pomona</a> transcript, turned around and headed back into my hands within three days.</p>

<p>Why the difference? Well, <span class="caps">UCLA </span>is a state school that makes money from its state budget and from fees. Pomona is a private school that makes money from annual giving. Giving doesn&#8217;t appear on the radar of <span class="caps">UCLA, </span>and probably shouldn&#8217;t lest state schools crowd out private ones entirely. Fees, on the other hand, are a mixed blessing for Pomona. It&#8217;s nice to have ongoing income, but when you only graduate 300 people a year, how much money can you make out of $20 fees? On the other hand, maybe an easy, cheap transcript leaves a good taste in an alum&#8217;s mouth. Maybe an easy, cheap transcript gets an alum a better job faster. Maybe charging $20 for a transcript to an alum who has already paid $100,000 to go to your school will tick an alum off. Whatever way you count it, free transcripts must have at least a mild positive effect on alumni, which can&#8217;t negatively affect giving.</p>

<p>Transcripts: college business models at work.</p>
