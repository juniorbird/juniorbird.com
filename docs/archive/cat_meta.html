							<h3>Hi, This is My Old Blog</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov  9, 2013 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_meta.html">Meta</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Hi! Welcome to Juniorbird.com.  <a href="http://wadearmstrong.com">My name&#8217;s Wade</a>, and this was my blog from 2001-2013. It was about, well, me, and you can probably learn a lot about me and my journey over that decade-plus period. I&#8217;ve pulled out a few of the best entries below, covering a wide variety of topics. In the right column, you&#8217;ll find some travelogues I wrote on a few vacations I took over that time; I&#8217;m pretty proud of that writing as well. Enjoy! </p>

<p>You can find my new stuff at <a href="http://kaizendad.com">KaizenDad</a>. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/004217.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>How to Archive Your Old Blog</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov  8, 2013 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_meta.html">Meta</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I&#8217;ve had this blog for twelve years, and during those twelve years it&#8217;s lived on many different platforms. It started on something home-baked, switched to Movable Type, then lived on Tumblr, and finally made its home on Wordpress. When it came time to wind things down, I knew I wanted everything in one place. This is how I made that permanent archive. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/004216.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>And the Story Goes On</h3>
							<p class="date">Feb  1, 2013 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_meta.html">Meta</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I started this blog years ago for an audience of 1: me. I thought my writing lacked creativity, so I decided to try some creative writing. Later, it lived and&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/004203.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Oh Dear, Oh Wordpress!</h3>
							<p class="date">May  4, 2012 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_meta.html">Meta</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I switched to Wordpress a bit casually, maybe: I knew I didn&#8217;t want to stick with Tumblr, I knew I didn&#8217;t want to go back to good old Movable Type, and there&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/004159.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>So you may have noticed that I&#8217;ve posted a lot less lately. It&#8217;s not that I have less to say; it&#8217;s that I&#8217;m doing worse at saying it. Almost 2&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/004155.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>After a little bit of trouble with Disqus &#8212; heck, a lot of trouble with Disqus &#8212; I&#8217;ve switched commenting over to IntenseDebate. It looks like IntenseDebate offers some spiffy&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/004049.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Business is Slow</h3>
							<p class="date">Mar 21, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_meta.html">Meta</a></p>
						    	
							<p>You may have noticed I haven&#8217;t posted here a lot recently. Umm, sorry. I do feel bad; I miss my old digs here! But, you see, I think there&#8217;s a lot conspiring against ol&#8217; Juniorbird.com. Part of this is changes in my life; part is changes in the Web. I have a feeling there need to be some changes around here soon, and I&#8217;d like your input. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003810.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>The More Things Change, the More They (Hopefully) Stay the Same</h3>
							<p class="date">Sep 21, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_meta.html">Meta</a></p>
						    	
							<p>You may have noticed that it was impossible to comment here for a while. Then, if you follow very closely, you may have noticed that things looked a little funny here for a while. I&#8217;d like to say that was &#8220;growing pains&#8221; but really it was &#8220;middle-aged creaky pains.&#8221; The upshot is that this blog has been updated to <a href="http://movabletype.com/overview/">Movable Type 4.21</a> and everything should be better than ever now. Hopefully not in the way that a 47-year-old guy buys a Boxster to distract himself from creaky knees that give him a big old 1&#8221; vertical leap at the gym basketball court. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003726.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Got Wood?</h3>
							<p class="date">May 25, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_meta.html">Meta</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Somehow, the five-year anniversary of this blog crept by me &#8212; Friday the 23rd was the big day. Post #1 was a cheap, unfunny <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> reference. Since then, 683 more posts have brought 878 comments, most of them smarter than the entry itself. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003689.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I&#8217;ve been writing this thing for three and a half years now. I started blogging because everything I wrote sounded like a business memo, and that just wasn&#8217;t a good way to make date plans; now, I can write things that are occasionally amusing. And have long run-on sentences and snarky footnotes.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003090.html#fn1">1</a></sup> Yep, things are moving along. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003090.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Meet the New Look, Same as the Old Look</h3>
							<p class="date">Sep 19, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_meta.html">Meta</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Well, ok, it&#8217;s not the same, but, well, it sounded like a catchy headline. Anyway, welcome to my new look. It&#8217;s big, and it&#8217;s dark grey, and it&#8217;s got my moblog right at the top, and I love it. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002756.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I know I haven&#8217;t updated in a while; I&#8217;ll be back in a bit with a new host and a new look for this blog. Hope to see you back&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002737.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>The Importance of Keeping Busy</h3>
							<p class="date">Jun 25, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_meta.html">Meta</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Because two blogs isn&#8217;e enough for me, check out what I wrote at my friend&#8217;s great Web &#8216;zine. It&#8217;s all about my summer break and shit, yo!&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002681.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>In a sign that this whole thing is not just for the kids now, my dad now has a blog. A former academic and university administrator, he writes on the&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002405.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Sidebar Cleanup</h3>

							<p>My blog sidebar was getting kind of messy, so I pruned it today. Buttons should lead to things that provide value, and, best of all, I went through all of&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002403.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>How To Show Entries From Multiple Blogs on Your Archive Pages in Movable Type</h3>
							<p class="date">Jan 15, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_meta.html">Meta</a></p>
						    	
							<p>If you check out the \monthly and category archives below, you&#8217;ll notice that the formerly separate moblog, linkblog, and diary parts of this site share the same archive pages. A lot of blogs out there have just this kind of content, but store it completely seperately; if you&#8217;d like to have posts from your moblog, linkblog, and blog or diary, all on the same archive page, and are using Movable Type, you can do it by following the instructions below. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001816.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Yes, I know my <span class="caps">RSS </span>feed is broken. No, I don&#8217;t know why. I&#8217;ll figure it out when I get home from Costa Rica.

							<p>Yes, the archives are broken. I&#8217;m working on it; everything will be much better in a day or so.

							<p>As part of the general ongoing improvement going on at this blog &#8212; also known as &#8220;excuses not to do any actual work&#8221; &#8212; I&#8217;ve modified things to support short&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001669.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<h3>Commenting Works Again</h3>
							<p class="date">Dec 12, 2004 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_meta.html">Meta</a></p>
						    	
							<p>It should be possible for everyone to comment on my blog entries now. Yes, I&#8217;ve worked hard and have given all four of my readers their voice back. I could&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000927.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>With my business school application process over, using wadearmstrong.com as a second &#8220;marketing&#8221; blog no longer makes sense (not that it necessarily ever did).

							<p>Some of you may have noticed the Phentermine spam in the comments. Don&#8217;t you love spam?

							<p class="date">Oct 19, 2003 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_meta.html">Meta</a></p>
						    	
							<p>The problem with a personal site, whether diary, blog, photo album, whatever, is that it&#8217;s not always, as they say, &#8220;safe for work.&#8221; This comes particularly into light when you&#8217;d&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000293.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>What goes on a blog? It&#8217;s tempting to say &#8220;whatever I like.&#8221; But this is not true; the medium is a public one. Thus, content has to pass a kind&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000261.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
