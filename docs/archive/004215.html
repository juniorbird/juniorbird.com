				<p>The namesake of this blog is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umbrella_cockatoo">umbrella cockatoo</a> named Junior. Junior picked me back in June of 1998, and we spent 15 years being best friends. But, when the baby came, Junior changed his mind and asked for a new home. Now he&#8217;s gone, off to seek new fortune, searching for a home he thinks he can be happy at. And I think he&#8217;s not wrong to seek that elsewhere, even if it does leave this blog with no mascot as well as no story.</p><p>When I got Junior, I lived with a woman who loved parrots and her two birds; but shortly Junior and I found ourselves on our own. That time surely started with some troubles &#8212; for the first three months it was just the two of us, Junior wouldn&#8217;t come out of his cage to me. He clearly missed his first mom at first, but soon we bonded and were hardly apart thereafter. For the next dozen years, I worked mostly for myself and was at home all day long most days; Junior helped me at my work, hanging out on my shoulder or roosting on my lap as I typed. Sometimes, for a break, he&#8217;d perch on a wall and caw back at the crows, or up and walk down then driveway and say hello to neighbors as they walked past:</p><p><img src="https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/225396_157509184312501_4138422_n.jpg" alt="Junior down the driveway" /></p><p>It continued outside of the daytime, too. For fifteen years there was hardly a dinner I didn&#8217;t cook with Junior on my shoulder, looking on, or a pile of dishes I didn&#8217;t wash without the same kind of assistance. He&#8217;d stomp around the bed every morning as I got dressed, and, before that, perch on top of the shower door as I washed.</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juniorbird/8709164798/" title="Junior on the shower rod by juniorbird, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8554/8709164798_c9bce09f85.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Junior on the shower rod" /></a></p><p>Yes, he loved to play with a q-tip, he&#8217;d run it through his beak, hold it in his claw, and delicately remove the cotton.</p><p>And, of course, there were tons of cuddles: there&#8217;s little a cockatoo loves as much as being held closely and stroked softly. He&#8217;d make little clacking noises with his beak and whisper sweet words like &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;pretty bird&#8221; and &#8220;gimme a kiss&#8221;</p><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juniorbird/8709650024/" title="Junior on the cuddle by juniorbird, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8534/8709650024_a0cf2afb47.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Junior on the cuddle" /></a></p><p>The story obviously is: we spent a ton of time together, which a super-social, attention-hungry bird would love. And we were blissfully happy. He fell in love with my bride from the first time he met her, and he even loved <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Jake-D-Armstrong/140018092738778">her little pup</a> (sadly, not reciprocated). When we got married, the new family suited him well.</p><p>But then I got a new job, <a href="http://evolvemediallc.com">full-time at an office</a>, and we got <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Charles-Bean-Armstrong/212292112142859">a new pup</a> to be friends with the first one. Maybe, in retrospect, I can see Junior getting a little less happy back then. There were a few cranky mornings when he didn&#8217;t want to come out and help me shave and brush my teeth, and a few evenings when he just would rather be in his cage than feed the dogs or do the dishes. I didn&#8217;t think of it at the time, but I also didn&#8217;t find any extra time for the bird.</p><p>Nonetheless, when we moved to the new place, we seemed happy. The whole house was in some disarray for a couple of weeks after we started the move &#8212; a very last-minute thing undertaken with an 8-months-pregnant wife, as we belatedly concluded that our little bungalow wouldn&#8217;t fit a family of three &#8212; so the bird actually boarded for about three weeks around the move. With everything barely under control, I&#8217;ll admit to having had some nerves picking him up: Junior is a high-maintenance animal and I was worried that a brand-new schedule in a brand-new home would hardly accommodate him.</p><p>But he came home, and I thought we&#8217;d fallen in love again. I couldn&#8217;t believe how happy I was when we hung out, and he seemed to have good times too. Unfortunately, the honeymoon was short: soon the baby came along and I began to neglect everything except him and his mother. (In fairness to myself, I&#8217;d anticipated this and took delivery of a wide variety of new toys for him, to try to keep him happy until I figured out this kid thing and made him a priority again.)</p><p>Sometime in that, Junior stopped eating. You could tell he was sad: almost every day he seemed to want to be left alone. I&#8217;d coax him out of his cage, and we&#8217;d hang out, but rarely was it party time like it had been before. For six weeks I neglected him; then I suddenly noticed how skinny he&#8217;d become. And then I changed my ways. Every night we hung out, watched a TV show just us two, alone from the family. I made sure he joined me in every dishwash and every cook. We&#8217;d cuddle again and again. Even his days alone got fuller as I discovered that he loved <a href="www.nickjr.com">Nick Jr</a>. (I&#8217;d tried some &#8220;just for parrots&#8221; DVDs on him before and he&#8217;d hated them; I figured he didn&#8217;t like <span class="caps">TV.</span> Boy was I wrong!)</p><p>These were great times. The cuddles were adorable and Junior seemed happier. But he still wouldn&#8217;t eat. So we gave him fruit galore; a banana treat with one of us was fun, or a bite of apple, but a half an apple left in his cage would sit untouched until the flies found it. And he got skinnier, until you could feel his <a href="http://s815.photobucket.com/user/clawinnz/media/Cockatiels/IMG_3747.jpg.html">keel bone</a>. That&#8217;s how you tell a parrot is skinny &#8212; if the keel bone sticks out. Never in 15 years had I felt Junior&#8217;s keel bone, but now it felt like a blade as I touched his belly.</p><p>One Thursday morning I noticed him shivering in what was already a warm day. He was clearly too skinny, and he was only getting skinnier. It was time to do something, to put him in a safe situation in which he might eat more and, at the very least, wouldn&#8217;t starve to death. We made plans to send him to a safe home. My lovely wife took responsibility for the baby for the weekend, and I was able to make those days all about Junior and me. We hung out constantly and did everything &#8212; washed the cage, took showers, had <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMVS-dnZSpk&amp;list=UUvr3MLHluZ81qx5RjTXsL3Q&amp;index=3">dance parties</a>, did <a href="https://trello.com/card/i-spend-special-time-with-junior/5185bc9eeee170ff78007def/1">all the things</a>. And then we were done; there was nothing more special that I could do to make the most of the time we had together. We&#8217;d done it all, and we had for fifteen years.  It was time for him to go live someplace new, someplace great.</p><p>So we drove up to <a href="http://www.bluecrosspethospitalca.com/">his vet, Blue Cross Pet Hospital in Pacific Palisades</a>, and dropped him off in a nice big cage in a pretty room with a window. <a href="http://www.sfirescue.org/">The Sammy Foundation</a> is taking care of him now, and he&#8217;s put on plenty of weight and is doing great. <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/petdetail/26023480">He&#8217;s looking for his forever home</a> I wished I could give him but didn&#8217;t. If you are thinking of a bird, or know someone who is, they couldn&#8217;t ever do better than this guy, my best buddy, Junior Bird.</p><p>Obviously, with no Junior Bird there can be no juniorbird.com. As I said earlier, <a href="http://juniorbird.com/6581/and-the-story-goes-on/">the story has changed</a>; and now maybe the site has changed too. This will be the last story here, ever. It&#8217;s a sad goodbye for the site, to go with the sad goodbye for the bird. But this plot line is done, and fortunately there is a new one to go on to. I&#8217;ll be back in a bit with a new site, about new stories. See you then, I hope!</p>
