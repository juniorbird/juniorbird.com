							<p>Thank you for removing pseudoephedrine from our cold medicines. It’s true that compound had kept me up at night one too many times — clear sinuses or not — and&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/004091.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Thank you for taking me on a scenic tour of your city today, as I searched for parking for <a href="http://expowest.com">an industry conference at your convention center</a>. I never would&#8217;ve seen the reaches of Katella or Harbor avenues without the direction of the digital signs above the road, telling me where to park, what was full and what was open. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003667.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Thank you for coming so early this year. I really appreciate how you gave me the old get-up-and-go by taking away an hour of my wasted sleep time last Sunday, and how you  bring light to the evening hours. Those energy savings would sure be nice, too. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003666.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Thanks so much for keeping those two containers stuffed full of sauces you took home from fast food places. I really needed a Hot sauce from Taco Bell to go with my new <a href="http://ttp://www.tacobell.com/fresco/">Fresco Menu Taco</a>, and our forethought ensured I had just such a sauce. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003620.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Thanks for licensing <em>It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life</em> exclusively to <span class="caps">NBC.</span> I&#8217;d become somewhat complacent, watching the same movie every Christmas eve (sometimes several times! Thanks, <span class="caps">UHF </span>stations!). Fortunately, you broke me out of that rut; without your intervention, I never would&#8217;ve watched <a href="http://www.blackathlete.net/Boxing/boxing111803.html">Holyfield-Bowe <span class="caps">III</span></a> on <span class="caps">ESPN</span> Classic. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003601.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

I really appreciate how you tell me I&#8217;m &#8220;doin&#8217; it well&#8221; as you inform me about <a href="http://www.rhapsody.com/home.html">Rhapsody</a>, the subscription music service brought to you by <a href="http://www.real.com/">everyone&#8217;s favorite software maker</a>.<br />

							<p>Thank you for mangling the two fundraising e-mails that I tried to send out to my contact list. I&#8217;m glad that you ensured that I didn&#8217;t look too polished to the many people who I asked for donations, although I&#8217;ll admit that I&#8217;m not quite sure why. Anyway, I appreciate that <a href="https://www.revlonrunwalk.com/la/secure/MyWebPage.cfm?pID=366860&amp;CFID=645237">raising money for breast cancer research</a> shouldn&#8217;t be too trivial a task. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003278.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Thanks for leaving your car window open while running into the <span class="caps">AIG&#8217;</span>s place to pick up one last thing on your way to your weekend getaway. I really appreciate how you gave me the chance to replace that boring old Treo, iPod, and digital <span class="caps">SLR </span>that some folks just reached in and liberated. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003263.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Thank you for carrying out your personal cell phone conversation in your car. I really appreciated how, instead of &#8212; like many people &#8212; talking loudly in public, you spoke, instead, in a private place. However, it would&#8217;ve been an even more private place if you&#8217;d closed your sunroof. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003190.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I&#8217;m very excited to see that you&#8217;ll be in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758766/">a movie this spring</a>. I remember just a few years ago when I could look forward to a romantic comedy, or fun action flick, with you every summer. Those were good times, weren&#8217;t they? Those were the days when our love bloomed again. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003091.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Thanks for hosting another year&#8217;s New Year&#8217;s Rockin&#8217; Eve last night. I really appreciate you coming out and announcing the events of the evening, with the help of Ryan Seacrest, of course. And I really appreciate all of the execs who convinced you to come on TV again, despite the fact that your stroke gave you a massive speech impediment. And I&#8217;d like to thank you for that speech impediment, because imitating it was definitely a great way to get laughs from a very drunk crowd. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003050.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Thank you for getting divorced by Britney. I really appreciate that now you&#8217;ll have more time to spend on that which means the most to me &#8212; your music &#8212; and also to setting an example for me by bein&#8217; a pimp. You and your bad self and your bad five o&#8217;clock shadow are truly inspirations to me. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002903.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p class="date">Mar 28, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_dear_so-and-so.html">Dear So-And-So</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Thank you for providing me with that little shot of adrenalin this morning; it was a rainy, dismal morning, and I was a little groggy. Seeing you speed through the red light, and feeling my car skid just a bit as I slammed on the breaks in the wet street, stopping just feet from you, certainly got me going at peak alertness. I hope that I didn&#8217;t disrupt your cell phone conversation too much when I laid on my horn while coming to a complete stop (said action was refreshingly reflexive). <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002452.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Thank you for televising the Winter Olympics. Being both a typical male &#8212; infatuated with sports &#8212; and a typical American &#8212; jingoistic as all get-out &#8212; I rather enjoy the nationalistic, energetic competition of the Olympics. I also love the speed and danger of the many sports that rely on sliding on sharp metal or skinny plastic things for locomotion. It would be wonderful if you could intersperse your human interest stories with some actual sports, you know, like everyone expects from the Olympics. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002289.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Thank you for providing so much entertainment to me this morning with your loud conversation. As I was working in the courtyard, sitting at a table alone, I seriously considered putting on my headphones and listening to some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Mingus">Charles Mingus</a>. Fortunately, you came along and spared me the mellow boredom. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002271.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Thank you for <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001818.php">upgrading my voice mail system</a>. I very much appreciate that you managed to replace a simple, effective old system with something that is new, annoying, and not nearly as well-suited to the usage patterns of any conceivable user of your services. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002100.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Thanks for taking my trash can from directly in front of my house. It sure was unsightly, especially since it was black and my house is white; the contrast was just awful. Thank goodness it&#8217;s gone now! If only I just had some place to put my trash, my kitchen garbage is sure getting full! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002055.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Thank you for capping my mailbox size at 45 megabytes. I very much appreciate the periodic message telling me that I&#8217;ve used up all of my space and can neither send nor receive any messages.

							<p>I understand that, with today&#8217;s cellular telephone technology, you can contact me at any time. However, that does not mean that you need to contact me at any time; and that does not mean that, if you need to contact me, you should call me.

							<p>I&#8217;d like to congratulate you on your recent acquisition of about $70, a 40-year-old makeup compact, and four already-cancelled credit cards. It is truly a testament to your planning ability that you were able to lie in wait for my grandmother, in a place no less supposedly-secure than her apartment&#8217;s parking lot, and then snatch her purse before she even had a chance to get out of her friend&#8217;s car! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001582.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>At first, I thought that the all-hours late-&#8217;70s arena rock and hair metal was, well, eccentric but amusing. I mean, who really ever gets enough Boston?
