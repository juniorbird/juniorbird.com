				<p>So I&#8217;ve configured and set up and used OS X for a day, and I&#8217;m starting to develop an opinion. There&#8217;s a bunch of things I love, and a bunch of things I don&#8217;t love at all, and a bunch of things I just have to get used to.</p>

<p><b>Things I Love</b></p>

<p><b>Bluetooth</b><br />
One of the main reasons I upgraded to X was to make my address book talk to my cell phone. Success! While my <a href="http://www.nokia.com/phones/3650/">Nokia 3650</a> is not compatible with iSync, using <a href="http://www.symbianware.com/product.php?id=svcard60&amp;pl=n3650">SmartVCard</a>, I was able to export all of my contacts from Address Book and import them in my phone. Bluetooth file exchange has been fun fun fun - it&#8217;s easy to send files to my phone and recieve them from my phone. Only problem is, I can only send one file at a time - it would be nice if OS X would let me queue files for transfer, rather than making me wait for the completion of each transfer.</p>

<p><b>The new Apple and Application menus</b><br />
I realize I&#8217;m the only person in the world who likes these, but they sure work with the way I work. I always loaded up my Apple menu with stuff, but I stopped using it for everyday tasks like application launching when I discovered DragThing. Having system controls in the Apple menu is convenient and similar to the way I had my system set up before.<br />
Having application control options in the Application menu is also convenient. And I like that you have the name of the app you&#8217;re in right in front of you! Better than searching for Preferences everywhere.</p>

<p><b>The Look</b><br />
Yeah, everybody said &#8220;lickable&#8221; three years ago. But you know, it just looks like the OS of the future. I like to sit there and say &#8220;this is me, using the OS of the future.&#8221;</p>

<p><b><span class="caps">ODBC ODBC ODBC ODBC</span></b><br />
I haven&#8217;t used it yet, but about a quarter of my job involves fooling directly with databases. <span class="caps">ODBC </span>support lets me do that easily on my Mac. I love that! Databases are good for most everything.</p>

<p><b>Terminal</b><br />
I don&#8217;t like <i>having</i> to use the command line, but I sure like being able to do all those things that <span class="caps">UNIX </span>lets you do.</p>

<p> <br />
<b>Things I&#8217;m Not Sure About</b><br />
<b>Safari</b><br />
&#8230; in which I&#8217;m writing this entry. Fast? Yeah, and I like that. Pop-up blocking? Glad it&#8217;s easy to turn on and off. The famed bookmark management? Well, seems like what you could do in IE 5, if you knew what you were doing and how to use your tool. A lot of people turned off those side panes in <span class="caps">IE, </span>but that&#8217;s exactly the functionality they provided.</p>

<p><b>Those Buttons In Finder Windows</b><br />
I like that they get you places quick and easy. I&#8217;m not sure that I like that they&#8217;re necessary.</p>

<p><b>i Apps</b><br />
<span class="caps">OK,</span> I&#8217;ve loved iTunes for years. I&#8217;ve already organized my photos in iPhoto, and I&#8217;m a most happy boy! But iCal, Address Book, Mail? Seem like good apps. Not that many features. The look just isn&#8217;t as nice as Entourage. We&#8217;ll see how they feel when I&#8217;ve set them up fully. I do know that I like that you can show and hide classes of events in iCal - that&#8217;s a great addition already.</p>


<p><b>Things I Know I Dislike, And Am Pretty Sure I Won&#8217;t Start Liking</b></p>

<p><b>The Dock</b><br />
Several complaints:<br />
1. Clutter. Boy this gets full fast! Just a few commonly-used apps and a few system utilities open and yer entire screen is full.<br />
2. <i>Every</i> app is in there. Even the ones I don&#8217;t want, and never plan to manipulate, like DragThing. This used to be ok in OS 9, because the list of apps wasn&#8217;t out in front of you there. Now it is, so it needs to be possible to exclude certain applications from the Dock.<br />
3. Why&#8217;s the Trash in the Dock?<br />
4. I have an extended keyboard. Why can&#8217;t I map some single key, like <span class="caps">F15, </span>to show/hide the Dock, rather than using command-shift-D?<br />
I&#8217;ve solved most of these by also using <a href="http://www.dragthing.com/">DragThing</a>, an application and file launching bar with tabs and all sorts of customization that I&#8217;ve had installed since about 1997.</p>

<p><b>Those Flat Microsoft-Style Buttons</b><br />
A few years back, Microsoft decided that it didn&#8217;t need to put buttons in button bars on beveled buttons; these buttons could just be icons on flat backgrounds. For some reason, this has been imitated in OS X. Why not just make buttons look like buttons?</p>

<p><b>Buttons Without Labels</b><br />
In the Dock and elsewhere, there are buttons with no labels at all. Sometimes you get a tooltip if you mouse over a button. Guess what, I want to know what buttons do. Give me a label.</p>

<p><b>Brushed Metal Interface</b><br />
I&#8217;d always hoped this would make more sense in OS X. You know what, it does, at least for a few apps. It&#8217;s great in the iLife apps, which all use a single-window interface. It&#8217;s suboptimal here in Safari with a multi-window interface.</p>

<p>It&#8217;ll be fun to see how I feel about these in a month.</p>
