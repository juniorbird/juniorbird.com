							<h3>Lastday: Taurus 23 Year of the City 2006</h3>
							<p class="date">Apr 28, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Yesterday was my official last day of class at Marshall. Barring an incredible reversal of fortune on the two papers and one final left, I&#8217;ll officially have my <span class="caps">MBA </span>in just two weeks! It&#8217;s an exciting thought, and I&#8217;m thrilled about what is in my future. But, ya know what, I&#8217;m kinda sad too. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002553.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I spent the last two days thinking that if I just worked reeeally hard this semester, I could manange to graduate with some kind of honors or something. Now, this will shock those of you who know me, but I had actually made a <em>mathematical error</em> when computing my <span class="caps">GPA </span>and had myself at a 3.56, rather than the actual 3.48 <span class="caps">GPA </span>that I earned with all of my hard work etc. etc. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002539.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>The final sections of the feasibility analysis are the simplest to describe but, in some ways, the hardest to execute. These sections, the team assessment and the financial projections require you, even more than do the other sections of the analysis, to follow the first commandment of entrepreneurship: “thou shalt not bullshit thyself.” <a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/entrepreneurship/feasibility_analysis_steps_56_team_and_financials.php">Read More</a> over at my other blog!</p><a href="The final sections of the feasibility analysis are the simplest to describe but, in some ways, the hardest to execute....">Read on&#8230;</a>

							<p>This morning I got up early and fought my way through LA Freeway accident traffic and several packed-full parking lots to sit in front of over 100 prospective members of the class of 2008 (n.b. grammarians &#8212; &#8220;over&#8221; = &#8220;more than&#8221; dates back over/more than 400 years) and talk about my business school experiences. Apparently someone was deluded enough to think that I&#8217;d say good, positive things that would make these desirable admits come to school. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002531.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<h3>Will Somebody Please Explain To Me What The Heck Is Up With Spam These Days?</h3>

							<p>Was a time when the spam that flooded my mailbox was <strong>real</strong> spam, giving me the specifics on how to gain a few inches where it counts or lose weight or get <span class="caps">OEM </span>software or whatever. These days, I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on. To get around the filters, spammers put every letter on its own line or throw in meaningless filler words or use eye-munging obfuscation in the hopes that my spam filter won&#8217;t figure out that h00d1a is a common spam word but that I will grok that it is a weight-loss product.  <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002517.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<h3>Downtown LA's Evolving Skyline Tour</h3>

							<p>The fun <a href="http://www.marshall.usc.edu/Clubs/ASM.cfm?doc_id=5228">Art Society of Marshall</a> was kind enough to work out a deal with the LA Conservancy whereby we could take their <a href="http://www.laconservancy.org/tours/tours_main.php4#broadway">tour of downtown&#8217;s evolving skyline</a>, so, needing an opportunity to give my <a href="http://amazon.com/o/ASIN/B000A7JKMW/wadearmstrong-20/ref=nosim/">new camera body</a> a workout, I jumped at the chance. The tour turned out to be fascinating, although I spent more time setting up shots than listening to the knowledgeable guide. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002506.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Will Somebody Please Explain to Me Why They Put the Lane Markers the Long Way at the Pool?</h3>
							<p class="date">Apr 19, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_will_somebody_please_explain_to_me.html">Will Somebody Please Explain To Me...</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I like it when the pools are set up with 25-meter lengths. It&#8217;s easy to gut it through just one more length when they&#8217;re that short, and the 25-meater lengths give twice as many lanes as do the 50-meter length. Sure, with a circuit you can easily fit four people in a 50-meter lane, but, for us marginally-fit trying-to-get-in-shape swimmers, we&#8217;re not really consistent enough to kee pfrom running into each other, so it&#8217;s lane-splitting or bust. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002503.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<h3>Smells Like Poo!</h3>
							<p class="date">Apr 15, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_sightings.html">Sightings</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I went downtown with the Art Society of Marshall today, on a tour of <a href="http://www.laconservancy.org/tours/tours_main.php4#broadway">the LA skyline</a>. We were accompanied, on the early part of our tour, by an escort of downtown&#8217;s finest; that is to say, an African-American homeless man pushing a shopping cart full of flattened cardboard boxes. This worthy was clearly trying to inform us of some of the more subtle things around us: &#8220;smells like poo!&#8221; he&#8217;d yell, at the top of his lungs. &#8220;Smells like poo?&#8221; &#8220;SMELLS like poo!&#8221; The inflection varied between outbursts, almost as if he was trying to say different things (just like Junior can mean three different things when he says &#8220;hello!&#8221;). <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002491.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Watching the talking heads on <span class="caps">TV, </span>it seems like everyone&#8217;s spouting off about keeping the borders secure, about not rewarding immigrants who have come to the US illegally, and about how much it costs to finance illegal immigrants here in the <span class="caps">US.</span> Well, I&#8217;ve got bad news for you all, but those are exactly the wrong questions to be asking here. In fact, these questions are wrong in two ways: there is a better question to ask, and these questions distract from the real issues. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002484.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>The Shyest Tagger</h3>

							<p>Walking to the store, I saw a tall, nervous man, wearing a baby-blue North Carolina baseball cap, ambling along, looking furtively from side to side. Near the Halal Carneceria, he stopped and, turning around in a couple of little circles, took in everything on the block. Then he sidled up to the water vending machine, leaned against it all cool-like for a second, and slinked in behind it. As I walked past and down to Venice, I could barely see the tall man, he was pressed so close to the water machine. What was he doing? <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002479.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Since all the kids these days are taking a position on immigration, I guess I&#8217;d better throw in my two cents. Goodness knows, I&#8217;m sure to have either an exciting, progressive position or a fantastically racist. Or, more likely, both, since I&#8217;m both a raving liberal and a white American.
