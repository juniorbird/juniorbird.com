				<p>One of the things we do a billion of here in b-school is <a href="http://cleverbird.com/wiki/InformationalInterviews/InformationalInterviews">informational interviews</a>.  The goals of these interviews are typically to learn which skills we need to broadcast in order to get into an industry, as well as make a contact in the industry who can later point us to jobs. I always try to tack on to that a few questions about how I can get the most out of the remainder of my <span class="caps">MBA </span>education. The guy I was speaking with on Wednesday had what I&#8217;ve come to realize is an excellent insight: there&#8217;s not enough time in an <span class="caps">MBA </span>to learn everything you&#8217;d like, but that first class in an area outside of your concentration will give you a lot more learning than that fifth class inside your concentration.</p>

<p>This stuck to me. I&#8217;m a bit disappointed with my Marketing class this term &#8212; not because it&#8217;s bad, but just because there&#8217;s a lot of overlap with what I&#8217;ve learned in the past. On the other hand, I learn about fifteen new things in every Valuations or Feasibility Analysis class period. So there&#8217;s clearly something to this statement.</p>

<p>Heck, I&#8217;m even learning a lot in Business Law. We just had our midterm in that class last night, and boy that test was pages of multiple-choice hypotheticals; it looked like something from the <a href="http://brenditabonita.blogspot.com/">ex-WG&#8217;s</a> law school study packets (I wouldn&#8217;t glorify it by making it sound like a law school test, but my exam was filled with obscure stuff).</p>

<p>I was actually quite relieved by that exam, because I&#8217;d done the practice tests in the workbook and had gotten several problems &#8220;wrong&#8221;. I put &#8220;wrong&#8221; in quotes because the workbook seems to have serious problems with English language compliance; some of these questions had awful triple or quadruple negations, non-specific pronouns that could refer to either a plaintiff, a defendant, a bystander, or, perhaps, an automobile or the law itself; and, in a remarkable accomplishment, misspelled John Rawls&#8217;s name every single time it was mentioned in the chapter on Ethics.</p>

<p>Now Rawls&#8217;s name was right in the textbook itself, but other things weren&#8217;t. One example: in a long excerpt of the Chinese constitution, the word &#8220;Article&#8221; was misspelled in every single article heading. That&#8217;s &#8220;Aritcle&#8221; in 32-point type. The textbook and workbook together may have cost $160 but at least I saved money since they clearly didn&#8217;t hire an editor.</p>

<p>All that goes to say:</p>


<ol>
<li>I&#8217;m taking an Operations course next term</li>
<li>I really hope the text in said course is well-edited, because, if our professors won&#8217;t bother to turn out English language-compliant work product, how can we expect our graduates to?</li>
</ol>



<p>If I were a good b-school student, I&#8217;d be able to see the business opportunity in the above sentence. Instead, I&#8217;m just going to go out and drink tonight and bemoan the collapse of Western Civilization.</p>

                    <p>I had that experience, actually, in my undergrad days.  I found the stuff outside my major more enjoyable, largely because there was a lot more variety.  As a result, I kinda put more effort and enthusiasm into my electives than into the courses that &#8220;counted&#8221;.  I ended up with a noticably higher GPA in my non-major courses than in either of my two majors. :-/</p>
