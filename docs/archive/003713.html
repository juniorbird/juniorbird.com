				<p>So I grew up in a part of the country where national politics was everyday news. All the Senators and Cabinet members and whatnot were just down the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltimore-Washington_Parkway">B-W Parkway</a> and their foibles were as likely to make the Maryland section of the paper as the National. And I absorbed it all &#8212; I had opinions on all the Secretaries, every Senator, the fitness of the overall Congressional delegation from each state, to say nothing of policy issues. But I didn&#8217;t watch Obama tonight. Sadly, I just don&#8217;t care.</p>

<p>As with most everything else bad in the world today, I blame the Republicans for my apathy. I don&#8217;t care about Obama&#8217;s nomination because, to be frank, I&#8217;d vote for a coprophagous goat for President, so long as said goat were a Democrat. I&#8217;d had brief bout of hope that the <span class="caps">GOP </span>could nominate someone I wasn&#8217;t totally against when McCain &#8212; who had come off as clearheaded and upright back in 2000 &#8212; got the nomination. But now he&#8217;s just parroting<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003713.html#fn1">1</a></sup> the Bush line on most every policy. Heck, he even supported that asinine gas tax holiday idea, and he supports offshore drilling.</p>

<p>Of course, none of that really matters since I couldn&#8217;t vote for a Republican anyway. I&#8217;m offended by their use of rhetoric over the past 8 years, and by their use of racism as long as I can remember. I grew up in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland%27s_7th_congressional_district">a majority-black district</a> that regularly elected a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kweisi_Mfume">black Representative</a><sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003713.html#fn2">2</a></sup> in which the <span class="caps">GOP </span>wasn&#8217;t shy to run a white guy on the &#8220;don&#8217;t vote for the black guy, he doesn&#8217;t know how to run things, vote for the white guy he knows how to run the plantation right&#8221; ticket. Later, <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/bal-te.md.turnout04nov04,0,2250241.story?coll=bal-local-headlines">the Republican party distributed fliers</a> telling people that the Presidential election was on Wednesday, not Tuesday, and threatening arrest for even people with traffic tickets.</p>

<p>So voting Republican isn&#8217;t an option. But, then, does it matter? By hook or by crook, Florida went Republican in 2000 and Ohio in 2004. Doesn&#8217;t surprise me that the racists, bankrupt of actual ideas, would steal an election.</p>

<p>Okay, maybe I could get excited about some barricades. But, seriously, everyone&#8217;s so polarized, do you know <strong>anyone</strong> who would switch the party of their vote this year? Me neither. So, since it&#8217;s already fixed out there, how do I get excited?</p>
