							<h3>Attack of the Lightbulbs</h3>
							<p class="date">Jun 28, 2007 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_otherwise_uncategorized.html">Otherwise Uncategorized</a></p>
						    	
							<p>About a month ago, my desk lamp in my office quit working. I figured it burnt out, so I changed the lightbulb, but there was no more light with the new bulb than with the old. Sadly, I classified my &#8217;50s-style lamp as dead. Then, today, the light in my kitchen went out. I replaced the bulb but: nothing. So I washed the dishes in the dark, and vowed to call the landlord tomorrow, when he was in the office. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003348.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>In Which I Reveal My Real Feelings on the Martini</h3>

							<p>I fear I&#8217;m about to make a great many enemies; but it can&#8217;t be avoided. Sometimes, one has strong opinions, and it&#8217;s at those times that one must stand up and state one&#8217;s beliefs, damn the consequences. This is one of those times. And this is my belief: A Martini is not a gin drink, or a vodka drink: it&#8217;s a vermouth drink. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003342.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>New Camera!</h3>

							<p>I got a new dSLR! Yay! It&#8217;s party time at my house! Also, thank Farmer&#8217;s Insurance time. I&#8217;ve been itching to take some photos for weeks now (of course I wanted to shoot as soon as I had no camera!), and there could be no better birthday present than finally getting a digital <span class="caps">SLR </span>again. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003339.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>It's Official: I Can't Vote For Hillary</h3>

							<p>I had been skeptical of her ability to make good decisions, given her support for the Iraq war, but this really proves that her judgment can&#8217;t be trusted. I mean, some things are just obviously bad decisions. And, please, going Canadian at a moment like this? I think you&#8217;ll agree with me after you see this embarrassment: <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003336.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>And I Shall Call Them the Tweaker Rich</h3>

							<p>Many of those who live in the <a href="http://www.palms-california.us/staticpages/index.php?page=20051125145006742%23Anchor-CHARNOCK-37516">Charnock Ranch Historic Business Area</a> apparently have no particular job; I see them gadding about every mid-day and every afternoon. Of course, if I had anything to do myself, then I wouldn&#8217;t be out to see my neighbors, but that&#8217;s not the point of this blog entry. The point is that these obviously unemployed people &#8212; unkempt, nappy-haired, filthy-clothed, pockmarked, hollow-cheeked, pinpointed pupils &#8212; have a lot more going on, cash flow-wise, than I had expected. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003334.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
							
							<h3>Why Apple Wants Web Apps for the iPhone</h3>
							<p class="date">Jun 18, 2007 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_elsewhere.html">Elsewhere</a></p>
							
							<p>At last week&#8217;s Apple World Wide Developer Conference, Apple <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CEO</span></span> Steve Jobs revealed how third-party software developers could get their programs on the hotly-anticipated iPhone: they could write Web applications that iPhone users could access through the iPhone&#8217;s integrated Safari browser. A lot of traditional application developers are pissed off by this; a lot of Web developers are enthused. Apple doesn&#8217;t care. They didn&#8217;t choose this approach to make developers happy, or even for technical reasons; Apple is focusing on Web apps because this is the only strategy that will bring them back into the business space.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/business/why_apple_wants_web_apps_for_the_iphone.php">Read on&#8230;</a>
						
									
				
					
				
							<h3>Introducing the Italian Blind</h3>

							<p>I swear they should have an Iron Bartender TV show, because you discover the most fun things that way! The <span class="caps">AIG </span>and I wanted a nice drink, and I don&#8217;t exactly have a well-equipped bar in my apartment. But I fooled around with the mismatched alcohols I had, and I came up with something absolutely delicious. So, here it is: the Italian Blind: <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003328.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Lomomomomo</h3>

							<p>It was late, and the sun was going down, and I was looking forward to seeing the <span class="caps">AIG.</span> So I was happy when she called me, and a little surprised when the call turned out to be not for dinner, but to take some pictures for her work. I had to rush; light would fail shortly. But when I got over, there was an unexpected payoff:<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003321.html#fn1">1</a></sup> the pictures were to be taken with a bunch of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lomography">Lomos</a>. <span class="caps">OK, </span>this would be fun. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003321.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
