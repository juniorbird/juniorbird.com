				<p>Now that I live in a blended household, I find myself using our phone number at checkout counters to save the few percent that some loyalty program gives. In the old days, this would&#8217;ve been an easy job: type our happy home&#8217;s phone number into that swipe-your-credit-card-and-sign pad and we&#8217;re done. But, like the modern kids we are, we&#8217;re cell phone-only and our happy is phone number-free.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t had a land line in six years, actually, and I&#8217;m not sure what I&#8217;d do with one now, even though I work from home. I&#8217;m not lonely enough<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003848.html#fn1">1</a></sup> to take calls from telemarketers. I don&#8217;t worry about needing to call 911 and have my address come up.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003848.html#fn2">2</a></sup> Really, it only ever comes up in checkout lines. What&#8217;s the number associated with my <span class="caps">CVS </span>card? My Ralphs Club? I need to be saving money, you know, this is important stuff.</p>

<p>Sometimes it seems like we should have a single number to give out to everyone, at which they can contact either of us. Pity Google Voice only has 424 area code numbers numbers left, I don&#8217;t need to have a home phone in some wacky brand-new area code that everyone thinks is a telemarketer calling from far away. Because my best strategy for having someone talk to me on the phone isn&#8217;t being taken for a telemarketer.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003848.html#fn3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>The upside of typing in Mrs. DJ L&#8217;il Bit&#8217;s number into all these swipe-your-credit-card-and-sign pads is that it&#8217;s the only time I ever type her number in anywhere. After all, who remembers phone numbers anymore? She&#8217;s programmed into my cell phone, like every other person I&#8217;ve met since 2000. It&#8217;s good to get the practice recalling her number, in case I ever need to call her from&#8230; jail or something, I guess.</p>

<p>That only leaves me to figure out how to remember what our Vons Club number is, so I can save a few bucks on jam and that awesome broccoli slaw. It ain&#8217;t lunch without broccoli slaw.</p>
