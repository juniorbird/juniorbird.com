							<h3>What To Do When Your Boss Sucks (and You're the Boss)</h3>
							<p class="date">Oct 18, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_bidness.html">Bidness</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I hate my job; I spend all of my day fooling with financial projections, and when I don&#8217;t get everything done that I&#8217;m supposed to, my boss hassles me and makes me feel like I&#8217;m a failure. Dammit, it&#8217;s just no fun at all. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002837.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>A Brief Commentary on the Apple Stock Option Trouble</h3>
							<p class="date">Aug 12, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_bidness.html">Bidness</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I&#8217;ve had a couple of friends IM me today asking me &#8220;what&#8217;s going on with the whole <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1155027932371">Apple stock option <span class="caps">SEC </span>trouble thing</a>?&#8221; Now, I know nothing more about this than the average business school student with a few classes on options and on financial reporting, but I guess that&#8217;s a few more than average so I&#8217;ll expound a bit on what appears to be going on, and if it&#8217;s serious or not. Everything below should be taken with a small grain of salt, at least, since there have been no public, comprehensive statements on what&#8217;s going on by either Apple or the <span class="caps">SEC, </span>but the stories in the press appear to be quite consistent and clear in what they&#8217;re describing. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002722.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Hail Sweden</h3>

							<p>Did you know that Sweden used to have a world monopoly in matches? It&#8217;s true, they made and sold pretty much all of the matches out there for a long&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001817.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Now That's a Leader</h3>

							<p>Sometimes, bosses say the stupidest things. Their mouths open and out come the worst cliches. But &#8212; even more incredible &#8212; that cliched phrase works. And then &#8212; poof &#8212; motivation! Caring! Inspiration! All the fruits of leadership! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001543.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Jack Welch Gives Straight Talk About Winning</h3>
							<p class="date">Apr 26, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a>, <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_bidness.html">Bidness</a></p>
						    	
							<p>In a much-touted event, former GE <span class="caps">CEO</span> Jack Welch spoke at the Marshall School today to pitch his new book, <em>Winning</em>, and, since I <span class="caps">RSVP</span>d for a ticket immediately I actually got to get into the event and look at the back of someone&#8217;s head while listening to Welch talk for two hours (Jason, you have exactly five gray hairs). Actually, it was a really incredible speech and I was very impressed by Jack Welch&#8217;s clear, straightforward style and his blunt (although non-offensive) honesty. A good role model for us all and a lot of great food for thought. I&#8217;ll probably turn into a corporate tool and buy <em>Winning</em> now to read what Jack Welch had to say in print. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001455.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Always Listen To The Marketers</h3>
							<p class="date">Mar  3, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_bidness.html">Bidness</a></p>
						    	
							<p>My Management Accounting Prof once told us this great story about how <span class="caps">TWA </span>went out of business because they didn&#8217;t listen to the Marketers. It may be a bunch of baloney, but when I hear the Accounting people say &#8220;up with Marketing!&#8221; then I figure it&#8217;s time to listen. Also, it&#8217;s funny. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001192.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Help Me Amtrak, You're My Only Hope!</h3>
							<p class="date">Jan  8, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_bidness.html">Bidness</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Like many Americans, I flew our nation&#8217;s fine airlines this holiday season. While I was waiting for my five hour-delayed, two-and-a-half-hour flight to Houston, I thought one simple thought: <em>this is a business model?</em> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A25814-2004Dec25.html">Ten thousand lost bags</a>? All flights on Christmas Day <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/TRAVEL/12/26/flights.canceled.ap/">cancelled</a>? I want my vacation to start as soon as I leave the door. And, Amtrak, it&#8217;s time for you to help me out with that. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001031.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Six Apart Buys LiveJournal</h3>
							<p class="date">Jan  6, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_bidness.html">Bidness</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I&#8217;m a loyal <a href="http://movabletype.org">Movable Type</a> user, so MT maker Six Apart&#8217;s <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/press/weblogging_software_leader_six_apar.shtml">acquisition</a>  of online journaling pioneer <a href="http://livejournal.com">LiveJournal</a> is of great interest to me. What could inspire the one company to buy the other? What&#8217;s the plan? It&#8217;s hard to see. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001028.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>It&#8217;s not just the content owners who have completely lost it; that old-line content distributor, radio, seems to have gone completely off the deep end as well. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000944.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
