				<p>If I were wheezing and gasping for breath as I begged for an appointment with my doctor&#8217;s receptionist, would you want me to keep it down during said begging? <span class="caps">OK, </span>you&#8217;d probably want to hear all the drama of my life since you were stuck waiting for your appointment. Being a gossip hound, I know that was exactly how I felt.</p>

<p>First there was the big guy who couldn&#8217;t avoid emitting a string of curses every time he moved. &#8220;Oh Jesus!&#8221; he&#8217;d creak as he sat down, then, vaguely, &#8220;Sorry!&#8221; Or, later, &#8220;Christ!&#8221; as he shifted in his seat, and &#8220;pardon me!&#8221; Standing back up earned a &#8220;Aww fuck! Oh excuse me.&#8221; At least he tried to be quiet. He didn&#8217;t try to be quiet when his cell phone rang, though: </p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Yeah, they think I have a hematoma. And cracked ribs. Yeah, it feels about like that. Naw, I don&#8217;t remember it all. Sure must&#8217;ve been, though! He keeps on calling me, says he wants to be my sponsor&#8230; I told him I&#8217;m not sure I want to take it all the way to sponsor, you know? More like a friend and a sponsor-y person to talk to. Exactly, I&#8217;m not sure I trust him! I totally think he was lying. Yeah, exactly. Naw, I&#8217;m not at the same doctor. Nah, he wouldn&#8217;t give me the pills. Yep, I&#8217;m gonna try this one, he works for Larry. Yeah, that&#8217;s right. No, I don&#8217;t wanna have the same sponsor as him, he seems kinda&#8230; hold on&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>I think that was when he noticed I was taking notes on his conversation. A pity, since I&#8217;d been waiting for a good fifteen minutes when this guy started talking. Fortunately, there were two kind souls who followed on that show to make my 45-minute wait seem as short as possible.</p>

<p>First was a short, square, older Latin man who stomped in with the bow-legged gait of a physical laborer. &#8220;Why you give my son pills?&#8221; he asked. There was some hemming and hawing as the man insisted my doctor gave his son samples and a prescription, and the doctor insisted he just gave the prescription. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you give him pills, you know he go to doctors and they give him pills and he take pills with a drink and he take too much of both,&#8221; said the man. &#8220;I only gave him amoxicillin and vicodin for the eye pain, he tried to get percoset but I wouldn&#8217;t give it to him,&#8221; explained my doctor, a short, swarthy man who &#8212; if the photos on his walls say anything &#8212; used to be an Air Force doctor and who graduated from <span class="caps">USC </span>but who seems to have season tickets to <span class="caps">UCLA </span>football.</p>

<p>I hope my doctor is not the guy to go for if you&#8217;re prescription-shopping. But that would explain his popularity.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s so popular his patients can&#8217;t wait to come back. One young lady, trying to lose weight, was coming in every six months. &#8220;I stopped feeding my cat seconds, too!&#8221; she said to her nurse as I passed her on the way to get weighed.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003417.html#fn1">1</a></sup> Old Black Lady Who Couldn&#8217;t Breathe also couldn&#8217;t stay away. She shuffled in, bright in her pink silk<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003417.html#fn2">2</a></sup> shirt and pink polyester pants.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hi honey. [wheeze] The other doctor [wheeze] finally [wheeze] diagnosed [wheeze]  me with a [wheeze]  breathing problem. [wheeze] I got tests [wheeze]  and everything! [wheeze]  I called you [wheeze]  a little [wheeze]  earlier [wheeze] and said [wheeze]  I&#8217;d be in. [wheeze] I know [wheeze]  I had [wheeze]  an appointment [wheeze] last Tuesday [wheeze]  but I was [wheeze]  too tired [wheeze]  to come in [wheeze] then, so [wheeze]  I thought [wheeze]  I&#8217;d come in [wheeze] now. [wheeze] Oh honey, [wheeze]  cain&#8217;t the doctor [wheeze]  see me [wheeze]  today? [wheeze]  I know [wheeze]  I don&#8217;t have [wheeze]  no appointment [wheeze]  today but [wheeze]  I was [wheeze]  hoping?</p></blockquote>

<p>She didn&#8217;t stick around for her non-appointment but I have faith in whatever doctor diagnosed her with a breathing problem. Still, she was a spry lady for someone I&#8217;d guess was in her late 70s &#8212; she kept on knocking things off of the receptionist&#8217;s desk, but she&#8217;d reach down and pick &#8216;em right back up!</p>

<p>See, with folks like that at the doctor&#8217;s, who needs TV? All you need is a phone with a little keyboard on it so that you can transcribe conversations while people think you&#8217;re just texting your friends. Like I&#8217;d text; I ain&#8217;t got no friends to text to!<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003417.html#fn3">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Anyway, I still have the same unspecified blah that I&#8217;ve had for the last two weeks, but at least now we&#8217;ve Run Some Tests. Soon I&#8217;ll have a name to put to all this and then it&#8217;ll be all better! It&#8217;s just like being in House!</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> I&#8217;ve lost weight. More on that later.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> Perhaps a rayon blend?</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn3"><sup>3</sup> I know <em>you&#8217;re</em> my friend. That&#8217;s not the issue here. The issue is that I&#8217;ve been in every night for two weeks because I&#8217;ve felt miserable, so I&#8217;ve turned all my friends away.</p>
