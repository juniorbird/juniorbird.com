				<p>With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings when friends come to call, it&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/~av359/xmas/carols/wond.html">hap-happiest season of all</a>! Yes, that&#8217;s right, there&#8217;s holiday music blaring from the speakers of all of the stores and malls out there and I love it. I wish July could be like this.</p>

<p>I realize this is an unpopular position to take, but, darn it, I think that holiday music is one of the very best things in life. What else is so happy, so full of hope, so expectant of a wonderful future? What else  is so generically nostalgic, so reminiscent of youth?</p>

<p>At this very moment, they&#8217;re playing &#8220;O Christmas Tree&#8221; (or <a href="http://www.mdarchives.state.md.us/msa/mdmanual/01glance/html/symbols/lyrics.html">Maryland, My Maryland</a>) on Monday Night Football. I&#8217;m beaming.</p>

<p>I think my love for holiday music started in elementary school. I&#8217;m an awful singer, but, in the annual Christmas Sing, I could belt it out and have my complete inability to hit any note at all masked by the golden-throated youngsters by my side. Who wouldn&#8217;t like an opportunity to, for once, sing sing sing?</p>

<p>Then, as I grew older, my rebellious instincts grew. I liked being different, dammit, and I still do. And, since everybody hates Christmas songs, I grew to love them. Yes, my passion for &#8220;The Little Drummer Boy&#8221; is a way of acting out against authority. And, so long as you and people like you &#8212; Communists all &#8212; keep hating holiday songs, I&#8217;ll keep loving them.</p>
