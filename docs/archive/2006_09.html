							<h3>True Love</h3>
							<p class="date">Sep 30, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_reviews.html">Reviews</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I&#8217;m into the whole <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2006/04/21/minimalist-wallet/">minimalist wallet</a> thing &#8212; the slim look, the lack of pocket bulges (I get enough from my Treo), and the fact that I don&#8217;t schlep half of my office with me every time I leave the house all keep me happy. My last wallet, reasonably well-liked if not particularly perfect (the money clip thing was a good experiment, but not a success for me) fell apart and was discarded without too much fanfare or too many tears. Its replacement, however&#8230; well, I&#8217;m in love. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002779.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Will Somebody Please Explain to Me What the SVN vs. CVS Thing Is?</h3>

							<p>I discovered <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/"><span class="caps">CVS</span></a> at the very beginning of this century, when I was doing Web dev. Getting past revisions? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">Diff</a>? Little notes on what changes I&#8217;d made? Life-saver. Even after leaving the industry, I kept much of my work in <span class="caps">CVS, </span>because revisions and branching are useful even for binary file formats, such as Word .docs or Photoshop .psds. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002775.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>The Affair of the Bottle</h3>

							<p>I did not &#8212; and this probably comes as very little of a surprise to most people who read this blog reguarly &#8212; spend much time in the Principal&#8217;s office in Elementary School. In all honesty, I simply wasn&#8217;t popular enough to have the chance to act out in a way that would gain the attention of the higher-ups. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002772.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Those Who Fail To Learn From History Are Doomed To Repeat It. Oops.</h3>
							<p class="date">Sep 24, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_ye_olde_politicks.html">Ye Olde Politicks</a></p>
						    	
							<p>One thing about me &#8212; a detail which makes me substantially less useful as a person from whom you can borrow a book &#8212; is that, like many geeky boys, I enjoy my military history books. My tastes in this genre tend strongly to more-technical works which completely describe the challenges individuals and states face and then give a complete history of how that challenge was surmounted (or not). Right now I&#8217;m reading a particularly interesting (to me), if perhaps somewhat detailed and dry, book, <a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0691015953/ref=nosim/wadearmstrong-20">The Arming of Europe and the Making of the First World War</a>. I&#8217;ve recently come to a chapter that describes the oft-forgotten Bosnian crisis of 1908, a historical event that, at the time, appeared to be a complete victory for Germany and Austria-Hungary but which turned out to be, unexpectedly, a complete disaster for those two Powers. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002769.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Meet the New Look, Same as the Old Look</h3>
							<p class="date">Sep 19, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_meta.html">Meta</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Well, ok, it&#8217;s not the same, but, well, it sounded like a catchy headline. Anyway, welcome to my new look. It&#8217;s big, and it&#8217;s dark grey, and it&#8217;s got my moblog right at the top, and I love it. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002756.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
