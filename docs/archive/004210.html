				<p>This is my second week back to work from my <a href="http://www.edd.ca.gov/disability/Paid_Family_Leave.htm">paid family leave</a>, and it&#8217;s stunning how my priorities have changed. For instance, earlier this evening, I was avoiding doing some work I&#8217;d brought home by changing a diaper instead. And you know what? I was changing the diaper because it would be <em>more fun</em>.</p><p>I noticed it the very first day I went back to work: I felt like I was wasting my time on unimportant things. Have a meeting? Design a new product? Keep the team moving? Nah, I might be behind on my nipple-washing.</p><p>(Side note: use of the term &#8220;nipple-washing&#8221; in non-dirty way is itself a big sign that things have changed.)</p><p>For the first couple of days, I nearly had to drag myself through my work. It wasn&#8217;t all bad &#8212; I was quite productive, knocking off one task after another in the hopes of clearing time to do my childcare. I was also bad at knowing when to say &#8220;no&#8221; to go home when I&#8217;d promised, but, hey, one worry at a time.</p><p>The reality is: right now, if Declan were awake, I&#8217;d choose hanging out with him over writing this blog or having a snack or meeting friends or any possible activity. But, at the same time, he makes me appreciate the time to write this blog or have a snack or meet friends more.</p><p>It&#8217;s great, all of a sudden all of my priorities are more precious. Just, some are more precious than others. Specifically, the odd new ones that mostly have to do with poop and spit. Ain&#8217;t it romantic?</p>
