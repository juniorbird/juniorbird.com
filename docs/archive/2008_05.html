							<h3>Flyin'</h3>

							<p>From the busy, crazy Honolulu &#8212; at least, if you ask the locals, it&#8217;s a high-stress, high-traffic place &#8212; we flew on one of those <a href="http://www.crj.bombardier.com/CRJ/en/home_crj.jsp?langId=en&amp;crjId=200">little jets made by dirty Canucks</a>, to sunny and slower Kauai. The &#8220;garden isle&#8221; of <strikethrough>Ceti Alpha 5</strikethrough> Hawaii, Kauai has a cute little airport that looks like it&#8217;s made of Lincoln Logs and is open to the air. Walking to get our rental car, we discovered that the laid-back Hertz staff had shut down for the day; but we caught a shuttle, got our car, and, despite signage that was either absent or the size of postage stamps, navigated to the hotel.<br />

							<p>Today, we tore right through our to-do list, just like two good type As.

							<h3>Will You Need a Blue Sky Holiday?</h3>

							<p>Today was a very relaxing day; which was good, because we both needed it. Normally, I plan out my vacations ahead of time &#8212; learn what sites I want to see at each stop, plan out the day to make sure I hit my itinerary, and make sure my list is completed each day. But this has been a less-planned trip, and we&#8217;re trying to relax. This is what happens when two type As relax. To wit, today&#8217;s complete schedule: <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003691.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>The Secret Word is "Vacation"</h3>

							<p>As promised, I am in fact on vacation. The <span class="caps">AIG </span>and I are on a trip to Hawaii; badly needed, since this will make something like two vacations since 2000 for each of us. Perhaps I should&#8217;ve brought a book on how to relax? <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003690.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Somehow, the five-year anniversary of this blog crept by me &#8212; Friday the 23rd was the big day. Post #1 was a cheap, unfunny <a href="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a> reference. Since then, 683 more posts have brought 878 comments, most of them smarter than the entry itself. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003689.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
