				<p>I got back on track tonight with a win in the cooking competition. My Thai Beef Noodles turned out tasty &#8212; I believe the flavor was described by one of my competitors as &#8220;very smooth.&#8221;</p>

<p>In all honesty, it wasn&#8217;t my best work. I used ordinary soy sauce, and forgot how salty it could be. While the dish was full of flavor, the salt really did overpower everything. I was worried that this problem would doom me to an easy defeat, but there seemed to be something in the air this week &#8212; my main opposition&#8217;s dish came out a bit too spicy. It was a good Asian dish, featuring some tasty veggies and a great peach chutney, unfortunately overpowered by the spicy.</p>

<p>We also had a new competitor, and, prospectively, two more next week. The new competitor had a good start, barbecued chicken and pasta; I&#8217;ll be excited to see what he brings next week. </p>

<p>And I&#8217;m excited about my handiwork. While the Thai Beef Noodles were too salty, they were well-executed. The rice noodles &#8212; which I&#8217;ve always made gummy in the past &#8212; were the right combination of soft and chewy; the onions and chilis and fish sauce melded together into a single wonderful flavor; and the beef was cooked just right and cut into pieces of the right size. I executed well, and would have pulled it off against most competition, but for the saltiness. So, next time, I&#8217;ll be even better. Next week, I&#8217;ll take it again. I wonder what I&#8217;ll pull out of my recipe file?</p>

<p>Now I just need that sucka who I&#8217;m trying to make a trade with in one of my Fantasy leagues to pull the trigger. I mean, he&#8217;s got Jamal Lewis, he needs Chester Taylor (Jamal&#8217;s backup, who&#8217;s been better so far this year), I have Chester Taylor, I need a Wide Receiver, he has Deion Branch as his #3 out of 5 perfectly serviceable receivers, what&#8217;s the holdup here?</p>
