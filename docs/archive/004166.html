				<p>Last weekend was my birthday! Happy Birthday me, indeed, for I got a new camera! It was well time &#8212; my trusty <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/products/canon/slrs/canon_eos400d">Canon Rebel XTi</a> was getting long-in-the-tooth. From the broken flash to what I was starting to fear was a decline in the quality of the sensor &#8212; to say nothing of things like the poor low-light performance the camera always had &#8212; this year was going to be the year for a new camera.</p><p>That just left the question of which camera to get. With a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002330FJ8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wadearmstrong-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002330FJ8&amp;quot;">couple of lenses</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007E7JU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wadearmstrong-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00007E7JU">I loved</a>, sticking with the system I had, and just upgrading to a newer body, sure was alluring. But, there was the issue of size.</p><p>Back when I was a swingin&#8217; single <a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/PRIME">traveling</a> <a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/Mexico-City-2005">the</a> <a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/Costa-Rica-2005-2006">world</a> <a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/Southeast-Asia-Summer-2006">alone</a>, it didn&#8217;t matter if I had some gigantic camera hanging around my neck. But now I&#8217;m grown up and also go to social events with my beautiful wife &#8212; events at which it would be great to have a camera. Yet I&#8217;m stuck with my iPhone, which is handy and all but leaves me without exposure and depth-of-field control, plus takes forever to get to the &#8220;shutter clicks&#8221; state. Something smaller would be appealing.</p><p>Enter the blandly-named <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/articles/8986630048/mirrorless-roundup-2011">Compact System Cameras</a>. A bunch of manufacturers decided to build a <span class="caps">DSLR </span>equivalent that did more in digital and less through old-fashioned glass. If I chose one of these, I&#8217;d have to step away from my beloved Canon interface (what I learned to shoot on in High School!) and those lenses, but I could potentially get something both fully controllable and easily pocketable!</p><p><span class="caps">OK,</span> I was sold. I went to <a href="http://samys.com">Samy&#8217;s</a> down the street and tried some stuff out. And the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00604YTFM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wadearmstrong-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00604YTFM">Panasonic GX-1 handled like a dream</a>. There are so many cool things on this camera that I haven&#8217;t even scratched the surface. Interaction design is great, with smart touches like one wheel easily switching between aperture/shutter/exposure, so your finger&#8217;s always on the right spot and you&#8217;re not having to do crazy hand gymnastics to push two buttons at the same time you spin a wheel; and the video viewfinder zooming on the center of focus when you switch to manual focus, so it&#8217;s easy to focus just right, which might even work better than a split-focus screen!</p><p>Oh, and it&#8217;s small, did I mention? This is the new GX-1 compared to the Rebel XTi, both with the lens I&#8217;d carry on an ordinary tourist day, walking around a new city (GX-1 on the right):<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juniorbird/7476287050/" title="photo by juniorbird, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8142/7476287050_71333c96cd.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="photo" /></a></p><p>Yeah, that&#8217;s small. Heck, the new GX-1&#8217;s even shorter:<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juniorbird/7476284820/" title="photo by juniorbird, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8157/7476284820_48a14d3756.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="photo" /></a></p><p>I&#8217;ve already tried it, and that 14-40 lens is totally pocketable. And, for when I want to go really small, I got an Olympus pancake lens:<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juniorbird/7476289002/" title="photo by juniorbird, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8005/7476289002_9966882abe.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="photo" /></a>Practically as flat as any compact camera out there!</p><p>I&#8217;ve only taken about 40 photos, but some of them look pretty nice, like this one:<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juniorbird/7476838012/" title="P1000010 by juniorbird, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7259/7476838012_3e0b3e9e05.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="P1000010" /></a></p><p>I&#8217;m optimistic and excited. What a birthday present &#8212; I can&#8217;t wait to get out and shoot!</p>
