				If you’re a long-time reader, you may remember the old days of the <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_drink_of_the_month.html" target="_blank">Drink of the Month</a>. Well, we might not make this a monthly thing any more, but I think it’s time to try new things again. So, today, I fixed a Cold Comfort for the wife and a Barbed Wire for me.<a title="View 'Drink of the Month: Cold Comfort Martini &amp; Barbed Wire' on Flickr.com" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/28482702@N00/4850898441" target="_blank"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4135/4850898441_ba9ac9c979.jpg" alt="Drink of the Month: Cold Comfort Martini &amp; Barbed Wire" width="500" height="333" border="0" /></a>A few years ago, I picked up this book, the simply-named <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Martini-Book-Perfect-American-Cocktail/dp/1579127169/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1280708615&amp;sr=8-2" target="_blank">The Martini Book</a>. The wife and I used to drink a lot of Martinis, and it seemed like such a book would get a lot of use. Not so, perhaps since I discovered Scotch. So, Courtney (formerly known as Mrs. DJ L’il Bit, even more formerly known as the <span class="caps">AIG, </span>and now approving the use of her real name in this here forum) has been suggesting that we crack open this book. Summer being perfect for clear liquors such as Gin and Vodka, this seemed the perfect weekend to do so.Anyway, that picture: on the left is the Cold Comfort, which is:<ul>	<li>Vodka</li>	<li>Juice of a lemon</li>	<li>A heck of a lot of honey</li></ul>Honey-lemon martini? Absolutely! Heck, that’s one of the few things that could get either of us drinking a vodka martini, rather than the provably superior gin version. Now, I used mesquite honey, which is fairly mild, and I used a ton of it, and I got good honey flavor, but not a lot of sweetness, because, frankly, the honey didn’t enter solution in the cold vodka well at all, even after a <em>lot</em> of shaking. Next time, I’d use a stronger honey, maybe even avocado honey, plus a bunch of agave for sweetness, since agave <strong>will</strong> dissolve in a cold drink. (Simple syrup would even be easier, of course.)On the right is a bastardized version of the Barbed Wire. The Barbed Wire is:<ul>	<li>Vodka</li>	<li>Sweet Vermouth</li>	<li>Pastis</li>	<li>Chambord</li></ul>We’re out of Chambord, so I made an ersatz version with Campari and a big chunk of the above-mentioned agave. I might’ve used Triple Sec too, were I not out of it. (It’s an odd feeling for any Certified Mixologist, such as myself, to be out of Triple Sec!) I’d love a little more berry flavor but, with enough agave to provide sweetness, it’s a very drinkable and refreshing beverage. The anise flavor really comes through.It’s kind of a new resolution to put aside my stalwart Scotch for the hot summer and enjoy some gin and even vodka (as seen here! again, shocked, shocked that I’ve made <em>two</em> vodka Martinis today). So, probably more new drinks coming up!
