				<p>Today started with a wardrobe malfunction, included a language malfunction, included boats and mostly-naked broads, and ended with a back malfunction. Assuming I can get out of bed tomorrow, I&#8217;ll count it as a very good day.</p>

<p>But first, tuk-tuks, or the lack thereof. Now, since I&#8217;m paying per-minute I won&#8217;t provide you with a convenient link to explan what a tuk-tuk is, but I&#8217;m sure Google or Wikipedia can give you a good explanation with even the tiniest search. Anyway, tuk-tuks are emblematic of Thailand, so much so that my Lonely Planet guide has one on the cover; yet I haven&#8217;t been able to take a ride anywhere in one. That&#8217;s because the tuk-tuk drivers are so focused on running their little scam &#8212; taking me to some store where they get commission on my purchases, then sticking me with a high-pressure sales pitch from the owner, far from my intended destination &#8212; that, since I want to actually get to, you know, Thailand&#8217;s greatest wonders, I just haven&#8217;t been able to blow the time to take the cheap tuk-tuk ride anywhere.</p>

<p>Today I replaced the tuk-tuk with a cab, a boat, and the Skytrain. The cab was the source of that language malfunction &#8212; I was trying to get to the pier, but the cabbie didn&#8217;t know the word pier, so I tried to say &#8220;boat&#8221; in Thai but clearly bollocksed that up, so finally we agreed on &#8220;boat station.&#8221; Unfortunately the cabbie thought that actually meant &#8220;bus station,&#8221; and we got halfway there before the whole thing got straightened out. That brings us to my business idea of the day, which is that you get a whole bunch of bilingual Thai/tourist language speakers, put them at a phone bank, and have them translate between local service and product providers and the tourists they&#8217;re trying to sell to. For cabbies, etc., you could probably sell a subscription that would easily pay for itself.</p>

<p>At any rate, I got where I was going in the cab. Now I was only taking the cab &#8216;cause I&#8217;d lost an hour and a half in a wardrobe malfunction. See, before I left I decided to buy a whole new travel wardrobe, since there was no way I could pack 30 days worth of clothes, and my mostly-cotton wardrobe was not ideal quick-drying material for a tropical vacation. So, off to <span class="caps">REI</span> I went, and I bought a few shirts and a pair of those convertible pants that zip off to be shorts. Well, three of the shirts are great, but I went off in the fourth this morning and was immediately soaked to the bone. Worse, the shirt was soaked too. That being socially unacceptable, I went back and changed, and, to make up the lost time, took a cab instead of walking to the pier.</p>

<p><span class="caps">OK,</span> I realize this is slow, but I&#8217;m getting somewhere, I promise.</p>

<p>So that was my first wardrobe malfunction. Later in the day, one of the zips on my convertible pants got stuck, so now they&#8217;re permanently shorts. So, two wardrobe malfunctions. For the one shirt I give up, but for the pants I&#8217;m either going to replace them with some knock-offs or see if I can&#8217;t just get the zipper replaced. I mean, this is Thailand, right?</p>

<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s mostly frustrating to me; I realize this topic is fairly uninteresting to you, my loyal readers. You&#8217;d much rather hear about what I saw and what I did. So, here goes:</p>


<ul>
<li>I wanted to go to Siam Square, so I took the long, scenic, experiental route. First I got on a fast ferry and shot down the Chao Phraya, the river that goes through the middle of Bangkok. The river was dirty but the view was exceptional, a side of Bangkok that it&#8217;s probably easy to miss these days.<br />

<img src="/images/bangkok/riverhouses.jpg" alt="" /></li>
<li>Then I took the Skytrain, an elevated railroad, to Siam Square, walking through the busy commercial area and seeing all the shops.<br />
<img src="/images/bangkok/streetscene.jpg" alt="" /></li>
<li>I got to stop by Jim Thompson&#8217;s house. Jim wasn&#8217;t there &#8212; probably because he disappeared in Malaysia in the mid-1960s &#8212; but all his stuff was, which was nice because it&#8217;s cool stuff. Jim built an empire based on exporting handmade silk products, back when he was the only guy doing that, and he used that empire to buy a lot of cool old art for his house. He also bought his house, which was assembled from the pieces of various houses he&#8217;d found around the country; he loved the carving on the house pieces so much that he actually put the walls up backwards so that the ornamental carving faced inwards.<br />
<img src="/images/bangkok/elephantstatue.jpg" alt="" /></li>
<li>Then I went to the night market at Patpong, where I filled a number of orders from friends for souvenirs (Milla, I have your Thai slave in my bag now, although that leaves no room for my underwear).</li>
<li>Walking from the night market, my back started to hurt a lot, so I got a one-hour Thai massage which blew my mind but, unfortunately, only moderately helped my back. This little tiny woman had vise-like hands and, when she finally turned me onto my stomach to work on my back, she shoved me into the mattress with her knees in a way that can only be described as linebacker-like. I&#8217;ve never been into Asian women but, after that, I&#8217;m taking applications below.</li>
<li>Then I got waylaid by a man promising a &#8220;ping-pong show&#8221; at one of the bars at Patpong. I had studiously avoided the row of red-light shops, in order to focus on the knock-offs, but one guy finally got me in with a promise of &#8220;no cover!&#8221; I mean, how could I go to Bangkok and not do a tourist run of the red light district? The place was smart, they put the one hot dancer where I could see her from the outside, so I came in, got a drink, and was promptly rushed by eight strippers, two of whom I guess were attractive. Of course all eight wanted drinks, which was a little much; when I finally broke down and bought them the orange juices they wanted, all except for one ugly, older one left. She tried to sweet-talk me but with so little skill that I figured my walled would be sucked dry far before anything else was, and I called it a night. Don&#8217;t even ask me how much I had to pay to get out of there! And there wasn&#8217;t even a ping-pong show, although I did get to see one girl play with sparklers, if you know what I mean.</li>
</ul>



<p>Tomorrow: all about stairs, and why Tang is more like orange juice than orange juice.</p>
