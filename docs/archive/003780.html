				<p>I should&#8217;ve known when I missed the first turn to the <a href="https://mymarshall.usc.edu/mems/user/registerEvent.jsp?activity=getEventById&amp;eventId=1053">Marshall Alumni Holiday Reception</a> and my next four chances to turn around were blocked off by <span class="caps">LAPD </span>auto and bike officers that things did not look good. But I drove around the northern half of Downtown and finally managed to get headed in the right direction to park and head into the event.</p>

<p>In retrospect, it would&#8217;ve been better to head home and get the <span class="caps">AIG </span>the <a href="http://www.redmangousa.com/">Red Mango</a> she wanted. But, like any proper <span class="caps">MBA, </span>the allure of networking was irresistible. So I dragged the <span class="caps">AIG </span>in, promising her a cocktail of her choice.</p>

<p>I had actually gone to this thing last year. And it was great! There were 3-400 Marshall alums, of varying ages, at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Club">Jonathan Club</a>, enjoying passed hot hors d&#8217;oeuvres, a cash bar,<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003780.html#fn1">1</a></sup> and great networking options. This year: not so much. </p>

<p>It wasn&#8217;t the venue, which was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Athletic_Club">beautiful</a>. It might&#8217;ve been the crowd, which was small &#8212; under 100 when I got there, which was about 8pm in an event lasting from  6 to 10 (even worse, when I got there, virtually everyone was paired off having a conversation, and the pair is the most stable and closed group out there). It might&#8217;ve been the cold appetizers they offered, which were tuna sandwiches. It might&#8217;ve even been the lack of vermouth at the cash bar.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003780.html#fn2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>But most likely it was the band. Most of us &#8212; me, that is, and you, my loyal readers &#8212; would not choose to book a band for a networking event in which everyone wants to, you know, talk. One of the dim bulbs that seem to populate this year&#8217;s Alumni Association<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003780.html#fn3">3</a></sup> had booked a four-piece rock-and-roll-type band to perform some hot uptempo songs. You know like the always hip <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXcQGsoDkDk">4 Non Blondes</a><sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003780.html#fn4">4</a></sup>. Then it got better: some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq-ZmAYLeB8">Brandi Carlile</a><sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003780.html#fn5">5</a></sup>. Something we think might&#8217;ve been <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILpq6LDrUWQ">Grant Lee Buffalo</a>. Because what you need at a networking event is depressing music. And it was a good 10 of these in a row &#8212; at one point I was practically expecting the band to treat us to some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmo7tyrtGW0">Low</a>.</p>

<p>Not only did this band bring us down, but they were a force of nature. The lead singer&#8217;s power and range &#8212; and at least she had some excuse to try to sing some Brandi Carlile &#8212; steadily forced the crowd out of the main ballroom and into the cramped, pillar-filled anteroom.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003780.html#fn6">6</a></sup> The masses apparently were prepared to trade elbow room for the ability to carry out a conversation at some level below a yell.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003780.html#fn7">7</a></sup></p>

<p>Anyway, we finally abandoned the networking event. For her trouble, the <span class="caps">AIG </span>got <a href="http://www.gabysmediterranean.com/def/main.aspx">Gaby&#8217;s</a> for dinner on the way home, and she also got to tease me about how the program she got her Master&#8217;s from at <span class="caps">USC </span>&#8212; and it&#8217;s not a whole school, like Marshall, it&#8217;s just a program &#8212; had a much better party earlier this year. So much better. I guess we should outsource!</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> There was a cash bar this year too &#8212; they must know something about how Trojans drink</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> I have no idea how the bartender managed to make the <span class="caps">AIG </span>such a delicious dirty martini, except perhaps by making it surpassingly diry.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn3"><sup>3</sup> I would not be so judgemental, except that three nice ladies who clearly had some role in planning and running the event were sitting exceedingly listlessly at the check-in table, encouraging no banter, small talk, energy, or even promptness in check-in. They didn&#8217;t even try to upsell us on the <span class="caps">USC</span>-UCLA game tickets they were silent auctioning off, which might&#8217;ve been a mistake since they&#8217;d left the sign-up sheet out and I could see they only had one bid, which was not only low but rather less silent than I might&#8217;ve expected.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn4"><sup>4</sup> The fact that this video was made non-ironically makes it truly, truly priceless.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn5"><sup>5</sup> Could&#8217;ve used <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3riAMRswyM">something more upbeat</a> maybe?</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn6"><sup>6</sup> Running out of tuna sandwiches may have had something to do with this too, depending on your opinion of fish and onion at networking events.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn7"><sup>7</sup> Although, I will give the band credit, their volume level did give me the excuse to leave the ballroom when I found myself talking to someone who smelled like the weight room at a gym. The entire weight room. In use.</p>
