				<p>In our <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003015.html">last episode</a>, it was revealed that our hero had a very very sore shoulder. Well, insofar as it&#8217;s the holidays, and I&#8217;m with my family, and they&#8217;re footing the bill, and we&#8217;re staying at a hotel with an attached spa, I thought I&#8217;d get a massage. Because, as we learned in Thailand, <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002680.html">massages fix things</a>.</p>

<p>So I booked myself a massage appointment (only had to wait two days for it) and walked about 300 feet to the <a href="http://www.trellisspa.com/">Trellis Spa</a> next door. The smell of eucalyptus and soothing South Asian-inspired instrumental music greeted me, and I was soon ensconced in a deep chair with some (too-citrusy) spa water. Now, most everyone knows that doing nothing is acutally beyond relaxed, it&#8217;s boring &#8212; my normal state is doing two things at once so mellow is just doing one thing, and that not very hard. So, after a second of sipping, I whipped out the ol&#8217; Treo and began to play games on it. That held me for ten minutes until a nice woman took me into a small room and had me take off my clothes.</p>

<p>About 2/3 of my hour massage were spent on my shoulder. My masseuse said that, in the ten years she&#8217;d been massaging, this was the worst shoulder she&#8217;d ever encountered. I&#8217;m sure that was part upsell but the pain in my back told me it wasn&#8217;t all marketing. I got hot towels, elbows, pressure points, various infused oils &#8212; nothing would break my shoulder up.</p>

<p>Sitting here now, it&#8217;s kind of funny &#8212; I can reach behind myself and touch my back, and the right side is normal and relaxed, while the left is all hard as a rock from the bottom rib up. And this is after my massage, which I would count as good, but not better than the nice old Thai lady who was trained at the Thai Royal Massage School. I think I need me another one of those. Otherwise it&#8217;ll just be me and this back against the coach class seats in Continental. Ain&#8217;t that Christmasy?</p>
