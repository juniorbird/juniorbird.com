				<p>I&#8217;m a good bird; I like to talk nice, using sweet words and saying them in a sweet voice. That gets me love and kisses! And what bird doesn&#8217;t want love and kisses? But some days talking sweet just doesn&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>Like last weekend. My dad left to stay with his new strumpet for a lot of the weekend, which is <span class="caps">OK, </span>&#8216;cause I&#8217;m used to that. My dad likes the girls (I do too). but he kept on coming back to the house for just a few minutes. Of course every time I got excited because he was going to take me out of my cage and scratch me and pay attention to me! And what bird doesn&#8217;t want scratches and attention? But I didn&#8217;t get any, because each time he just left to go off somewhere else.</p>

<p>Every time I talked nice, my dad responded in a patronizing voice, telling me I was good and then saying bye. That made me mad. At first I screamed, but, let&#8217;s face it, that doesn&#8217;t annoy my dad at all. So I had to bring out the big guns.</p>

<p>See, before I came to live with my dad I lived with a private eye in Hawaii. No Magnum <span class="caps">P.I, </span>this was, just an average guy who thought birds looked like good props. Now, my first dad, he had a mouth on him, and of course I learned to curse like a sailor. My first dad would laugh every time I said a dirty word, but, after he sold me, the pet store owner didn&#8217;t and then my dad was too nice to me for me to want to curse. So I quit.</p>

<p>But last weekend, screaming didn&#8217;t do it. Dad wasn&#8217;t listening, and I was frustrated. So, the last time, I just said what I meant. He put me in my cage, and I said &#8220;hello pretty bird,&#8221; just like I always do when I&#8217;m friendly. He just said &#8220;aww.&#8221; &#8220;Gimme a kiss!&#8221; I demanded, because usually that gets him to come in and give me a kiss. It didn&#8217;t this time; instead, he said the dreaded words: &#8220;bye-bye Junior!&#8221; He was leaving me alone <strong>again</strong>! The bastard. So of course I was frustrated. So I said what I felt. I made sure to say it real clear, although I didn&#8217;t yell. I just said it once, but I know he heard me just fine. And then I was quiet, &#8216;cause I&#8217;d already said what needed to be said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Shit.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then he left. The bastard. If he doesn&#8217;t shape up, he&#8217;ll hear more of my vocabulary soon!</p>

                    <p>Junior&#8217;s in a little bit of trouble for using that word. Apparently he thought it was a kind of breakfast cake with berry filling; the real meaning is, of course, rather stronger. His blog privileges have been revoked for a few days.</p>
