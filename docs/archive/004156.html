				<p>I&#8217;m a big Instagram fan (<a href="http://statigr.am/photos/juniorbird">this is me</a>). Yes, even now that they let Android users on (hot tip: Android users I know seem to post almost no photos). But, as much as the app is charming, it&#8217;s weak on tools to help you find the content and people you want again and again. But I just found Instagallery, and I&#8217;m in love.The great thing about Instagram is that it&#8217;s really easy to take a shot and upload it, and really easy to check what&#8217;s new in a basic feed. But if you follow more than a few dozen people, then photos start to get missed. This is particularly frustrating when the photos that you miss are your friends&#8217;, and the photos that you see were taken by the 300 people you follow who shoot cool stuff but whom you don&#8217;t know. Sure, you can go in to the list of people you follow and find your real-life friends and look at what they&#8217;ve done one-by-one, but that&#8217;s not easy in the first place, and then there&#8217;s no way to save that list of real-life friends for easy access later. It&#8217;s the same story with hashtags for content-types you like. That&#8217;s where Instagallery comes in.<a title="photo by juniorbird, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juniorbird/7082871113/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7123/7082871113_f56278fb29.jpg" alt="photo" width="333" height="500" /></a>I can really sympathize with Instagram keeping things this way: focus is key to any app. But I missed having some kind of list-management features every day. At least, I missed it until I found Instagallery. Now it&#8217;s fairly easy for me to keep a list of the hashtags I&#8217;d like to follow and the people I want to pat on the back or needle.<a title="photo by juniorbird, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/juniorbird/7082871457/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7210/7082871457_73ef05acdd.jpg" alt="photo" width="333" height="500" /></a>It&#8217;s just that simple: you find the things you want to look at, then you save them. I can deal with that. Sure, there are other features, but if you open Instagram every day like I do, this one alone is worth $1.99. If you&#8217;re looking for more followers, I bet Instagallery would be an essential tool. As it is, it just makes Instagram more fun for me. Instagrammers: buy it!(And if you&#8217;ve noticed me like a dozen of your photos in the past couple of days, it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m stalking you, it just finally became easy to follow you, thanks to Instagallery, and so I&#8217;m checking out what you&#8217;ve been doing!)</p>
