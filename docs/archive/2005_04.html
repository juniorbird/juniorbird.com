							<h3>Jack Welch Gives Straight Talk About Winning</h3>
							<p class="date">Apr 26, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a>, <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_bidness.html">Bidness</a></p>
						    	
							<p>In a much-touted event, former GE <span class="caps">CEO</span> Jack Welch spoke at the Marshall School today to pitch his new book, <em>Winning</em>, and, since I <span class="caps">RSVP</span>d for a ticket immediately I actually got to get into the event and look at the back of someone&#8217;s head while listening to Welch talk for two hours (Jason, you have exactly five gray hairs). Actually, it was a really incredible speech and I was very impressed by Jack Welch&#8217;s clear, straightforward style and his blunt (although non-offensive) honesty. A good role model for us all and a lot of great food for thought. I&#8217;ll probably turn into a corporate tool and buy <em>Winning</em> now to read what Jack Welch had to say in print. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001455.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Potty Mouth</h3>
							<p class="date">Apr 24, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a></p>
						    	
							<p>While I have no particular memory of taking <span class="caps">GSBA</span> 547: Cursing for Managers this semester, I&#8217;ve either received some cutting-edge new subliminal training in how to drop f-bombs in class, or I&#8217;ve contracted <a href="http://tourettes.org/">Tourette&#8217;s Syndrome</a>. Either way, I&#8217;m contributing to the moral turpitude of the Marshall School. (Note to entrepreneurs: turpitude.org is apparently not taken!) <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001453.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Feelin' the 6am</h3>
							<p class="date">Apr 22, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I will never publicly admit that I like having 8am classes four days in a row. But I am now officially a convert to the whole morning person things. A flurry of e-mails at 6:05am? Makes me feel hardcore. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001449.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>What, Me Relax?</h3>
							<p class="date">Apr 17, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a></p>
						    	
							<p>It&#8217;s day three of a three-day weekend. And have I chilled out any? Of course not. I spent a whole day on activities. I spent a whole day paying bills and taking care of un-attended-to tasks. I&#8217;m in the midst of spending a whole day trying to get a summer job. TiVo has about 30GB of stuff I&#8217;d love to watch but Dean Voigt has a lot more stuff I need to do. Yes, it&#8217;s clear, what I really need is an intern. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001443.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>My Three Sandboxes</h3>
							<p class="date">Apr 15, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_true_life_stories.html">True Life Stories</a></p>
						    	
							<p>During my horribly-oppressed youth at a Quaker School, I, like many other children in America (and, probably, worldwide), availed myself of the pleasures of playing in the sandbox. Now, most sandboxes are places for children to dig holes and build mounds and get sand in their shoes; at my Quaker school, sandboxes were a tool to enforce conformity. And to get sand in our shoes. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001440.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Going Once, Going Twice, Sold to the Trojan Who Bid 700 Points For That One Course</h3>
							<p class="date">Apr  7, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a></p>
						    	
							<p>The way you get into electives here at Marshall is to bid on the courses you want. We get 1000 points, a list of the classes that will be offered in the fall, a prospective list of spring classes, and a list of the last 3-4 years of waitlists for classes, then we get to bid our points on the classes we want. The theory is, this procedure makes sure that people get into the classes they value the most; but that ignores all the things besides desire that go into a bid. Which made me ask: what, exactly, is it that bidding on classes measures? <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001428.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>End Government Regulation!</h3>
							<p class="date">Apr  4, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_otherwise_uncategorized.html">Otherwise Uncategorized</a></p>
						    	
							<p>A favorite conservative cause is the evil of government regulation. They rail against the economic loss caused by taxes &#8212; a loss known in economics as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadweight_loss">deadweight loss</a>. But who ever thinks of the non-economic deadweight loss caused by government regulation? What about the most serious loss of all &#8212; daylight savings time! Yes, just yesterday, the Federal Government&#8217;s inefficient regulations caused a deadweight loss of one hour to us all! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001421.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
