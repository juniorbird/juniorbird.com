				<p>I&#8217;ve been using a Time Capsule to back up my Mac for some time now, and have been very satisfied. I was wishing that I could run some kind of over-the-air backup for my wife&#8217;s laptop, which runs Windows <span class="caps">XP, </span>too. So I attached a <span class="caps">USB </span>hard drive to the Time Capsule, and tried to mount that on the Windows XP laptop. First I did it the wrong way, and there was much sadness. Then I did it the right way, and life was easy. I couldn&#8217;t find a description of how to do it right in a quick Google search, so here&#8217;s my story. It&#8217;s probably true for an Airport Extreme Base Station too, since that and the Time Capsule are similar.</p>

<h3>The Wrong Way</h3>

<p>Apple advertises that you can <a href="http://www.apple.com/airportextreme/features/harddrivesharing.html">share disks attached to its wireless routers using the AirPort Disk Utility</a>, if the clients are either Windows machines or older Macs. So I downloaded the AirPort Disk Utility, ran it, and easily mounted the disks.</p>

<p>Then I restarted, and the drive letters assigned to the disks changed. Obviously, that would be a problem if I tried to run backup software, which would try to copy files to a given drive that might or might not be there.</p>

<h3>The Right Way</h3>

<p>So away went the AirPort Disk Utility, and instead I:</p>


<ol>
<li>Went to the <strong>Start Menu</strong>, and opened <strong>My Computer</strong></li>
<li>From the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, selected <strong>Map Network Drive</strong></li>
<li>Picked the <strong>Drive Letter</strong> I wanted</li>
<li>For the <strong>Folder</strong>, typed in <strong>&#92;[IP Address of Time Capsule]\[Drivename]</strong> &#8212; so, if your Time Capsule was at 192.168.1.1, and your backup drive was named George, you&#8217;d type &#92;192.168.1.1\George</li>
<li>Hit <strong>Finish</strong>. And there was the drive!</li>
</ol>



<p>So, if you want to consistently connect your computer running Windows XP to a <span class="caps">USB </span>drive attached to a Time Capsule (and probably and Airport Extreme Base Station), you need to do it through Windows <span class="caps">XP, </span>and not through the AirPort Disk Utility. Simple!</p>

                    <p>I&#8217;m unclear on why you would need an external USB drive.  Are you backing up so much stuff to the Capsule that you can&#8217;t handle multiple machines on it?</p>

                    <p>Oh, also &#8212; did Windows switch from using double-backslash to double-forwardslash for referencing network locations?  I haven&#8217;t really been using Windows much for a while, but definitely the last time I was using XP, the beginning of network drives was &#8220;whack whack&#8221;.  (The folks I worked with at MS referred to the backslash as &#8220;whack&#8221;.  There are a lot of backslashes in MS-land, so you <i>really</i> need a shorter name for it&#8230;)</p>

                    <p>You are totally correct about the slashes vs. backslashes; I fixed it in the entry so as not to screw up anyone who comes here via google.</p>

<p>There were two reasons I wanted to use a drive hanging off the Time Capsule:</p>


<ol>
<li>I bought the small Time Capsule, and I was greedy to keep that little space for my own nicely-versioned Time Machine backup</li>
<li>I had an extra drive lying around and was looking for a good use for all that space</li>
</ol>



<p>I&#8217;ll allow that both are kind of silly.</p>

<p>When I tried essentially what they described, as in my &#8220;Wrong Way&#8221; section, I ended up with a drive that changed assigned letters between boots &#8212; a problem if I wanted to use backup software that referred to drive letter, rather than UNC path. So I tried the other way, and got a static drive letter between reboots.</p>

<p>(Maybe the real problem was that I needed smarter backup software.)</p>

<p>Anyway, the point is: my google-fu didn&#8217;t turn up the result you suggested, so hopefully this entry is written such that, should I ever need to figure all this out again, google will serve me up this page as the result.</p>

I need to set up Xta&#8217;s drive to backup to my Time Capsule some time in the next week or so &#8212; I&#8217;ll try to remember to let you know whether the Windows Airport utility works right on her machine (Vista) to get a stable drive letter, and any magic tweaks I discover in the process&#8230;</p>
