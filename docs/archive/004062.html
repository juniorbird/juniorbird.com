				2010 has been quite a year; there’s a lot to give thanks for, and a lot to worry about. Today’s a day for great food and great family, and I’m filled with thoughts of thanks for many of the great things in my life:<ul>	<li>My wife, who I’ve been lucky enough to have been married to for the last year</li>	<li>My parents, who are endlessly supportive</li>	<li>Our little black dog, who reminds me to be cheerful</li>	<li>Our white bird, even though he’s recently forgotten how to whistle the way I taught him — that is, on tune — and learned to whistle like Courtney, who’s lucky to make a wavering, tottering little noise from between her pursed lips. Junior’s learned a new song, and it’s not pretty, folks.</li>	<li>Our great friends and family, whose love and generosity at our wedding I’m reminded of now, around our 1-year anniversary</li>	<li>Great friends, who are helping me believe in myself and get a great job (more on that later!)</li>	<li>Krav Maga, which keeps me in shape and helps me burn off negative thoughts and energy</li>	<li>The Maillard reaction, which I like to use several times a week</li>	<li>Photography, especially film, especially the good luck of finding a little old Canon AE-1 at a garage sale</li>	<li>Writing, especially my ability to do a lot of it (more on this later too!)</li>	<li>And last but not least, new furniture and heirloom plates and servingware. It’s a lovely new season at this house!</li></ul>So, happy Thanksgiving, everyone! May your decisions this year be better than those of the Wampanoag, who kept our ancestors from starving so that they could then take over the whole continent.
