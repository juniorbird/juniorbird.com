				<p>I&#8217;ve been drinking a lot more wine lately &#8212; about a bottle a week. I&#8217;ve always enjoyed wine, and it was finally time to learn about it, which means trying a lot. I have little storage room, so there&#8217;s not much space for me to keep around bottles that I don&#8217;t plan to drink soon; but there are two bottles that have been taking up precious wine rack space for a while now.</p>

<p>The first is actually the reason <a href="http://corkd.com/people/juniorbird/">I joined wine site Cork&#8217;d</a>. Somehow, I thought this red &#8212; which is practically undrinkable &#8212; was spiffy enough that I bought three bottles in three different places at three different times before I realized I&#8217;d already had it. Now, of course, one bottle just sits there, and I have no idea how I&#8217;ll ever manage to drink it. That level of tannin requires some real fortitude to brave.</p>

<p>The other has been around much longer &#8212; since 2003, I think. In January of that year the <a href="http://juniorbird.com/mt/mt-search.cgi?IncludeBlogs=2%2C1&amp;search=wonderful+girlfriend">Wonderful Girlfriend</a> and I went to Santa Barbara to kick off our new relationship. Now, in retrospect, although she was significantly W, I might have chosen a different nickname for this individual, because I don&#8217;t mean to imply that other Gs can&#8217;t be W too; but at the time it seemed like a good idea. It also seemed like a good idea to take home a bottle of wine with us. We didn&#8217;t buy a good bottle of wine, but we had been wine tasting all day long and it was sort of the end of the day and a good time to buy the bottle; and besides, who cares? It wasn&#8217;t the wine, it was the two of us buying it.</p>

<p>Then the bottle came home, and I didn&#8217;t open it for us to drink because, frankly, I didn&#8217;t remember it being any good. Then I didn&#8217;t open it because it had been around for long enough that I should save it for a special occasion. Then I didn&#8217;t open it because we were having trouble, as they say in the relationship business, and I wanted to save it for a happy time. Then I didn&#8217;t open it because she was gone. </p>

<p>And so it sat, unopened, reminding me every time I looked at my wine selection. After a while, I hoped for a special enough moment with someone else to open it. But, this weekend, two things occurred to me:</p>


<ul>
<li>If I open me and the <span class="caps">WG&#8217;</span>s wine at me and someone else&#8217;s special time, well, there&#8217;s a third person in the room</li>
<li>I get 10% off if I buy 6 bottles of wine and I don&#8217;t have enough space for 6 unless I drink that bottle</li>
</ul>



<p>So I opened the cork, and I poured myself a glass. Thanks to one of those vacuum-pump stoppers, the bottle will last all week. And you know what? It&#8217;s a perfectly fine bottle of wine.</p>
