				<p>Or two weeks, more like &#8212; last Monday&#8217;s Microeconomics midterm plus yesterday&#8217;s Accounting midterm and today&#8217;s Strategy final. If you&#8217;re keeping track at home, that&#8217;s two entire weekends of studying for classes that I&#8217;m not sure I really get, plus last night studying for a class that I thought I got real good but maybe I&#8217;m not so sure after that final.</p>

<p>Econ wasn&#8217;t that bad. I knew I didn&#8217;t understand most of what was going on so I kicked my ass studying in a really systematic way:</p>


<ul>
<li>Making a list, and then flash cards, of all the formulae described in the chapters in question</li>
<li>Making outlines out of the parts of the chapters in question that I highlighted</li>
<li>Doing a few strategic problems and making some graphs</li>
</ul>



<p>The result? I think I did better than I expected. Not great, but within a standard deviation of the mean.</p>

<p>Accounting was awful. I though I understood it, I&#8217;d been giving people advice on it for weeks &#8212; good advice too, from what they said &#8212; but when I got a copy of last year&#8217;s test from the prof, I couldn&#8217;t even start to figure out how to do about half of the problems! So I shut myself up for an entire weekend and made ouutlines of every chapter. Then I tried the practice test again; couldn&#8217;t start about half of the problems!</p>

<p>So Monday night was pretty stressful, although I managed to keep well short of panic. For a change, I did problems in the book; actually, that worked pretty darned well. After a few hours of that, I was able to begin to approach the practice test. But I was also out of time and had to go to bed. In the morning, I studied the answer key to the practice test, and then took the test itself; not so bad, at the end. I&#8217;m not sure how many questions I got right, but I had an idea of how to approach all of them. So, yay partial credit, I hope. Certainly better than I&#8217;d hoped.</p>

<p>After Accounting, it was hard to get hyped about Strategy. I&#8217;ve been strong in that class so far and didn&#8217;t feel worried at all. I read the case, on McDonald&#8217;s, and the <span class="caps">S&amp;P </span>report on the restaurant industry. I made a five forces model and a value chain for McDonalds. I took notes on the case and reviewed some of the supplemental readings.</p>

<p>And then the test completely threw me for a loop. Multiple choices? Not once during class had we had to make hard, cut-and-dry determinations, so this format was quite a surprise. Other questions were easier to approach but most of them &#8212; even the short answers &#8212; could have been a full essay. I was fine on all of this section except for one essay, which asked how the four threats to sustainability affected McDonalds. The four threats to whatsit now? I managed to remember two of the threats (slack, hold-up), and made up two more, one of which was half right (the answer is &#8220;imitators&#8221; and &#8220;substitutes&#8221;). But I think I did OK in the end.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m trying not to worry; you know my new watchword: &#8220;within one standard deviation of the mean.&#8221;</p>
