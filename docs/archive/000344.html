				<p>About a month and a half ago, I moved into a new place. It&#8217;s a little house I found for rent about two miles away from where I used to live. The new neighborhood, to the southeast of the old, is lots of fun and filled with stores and restaurants &#8212; photos of that someday, maybe, in the future.</p>

<p>The house doesn&#8217;t quite fit into the &#8216;hood; all the other buildings are 10-20 unit apartment buildings but, on this plot of land, there&#8217;s just three small houses. They all seem quite old, with wood paneling on the interior walls and little internal wiring. But I love my new house! It&#8217;s cozy and has been fun to fix up. And, now that it&#8217;s fixed up, the pictures will begin.</p>

<p>Since, between the new job and the <a href="http://wadearmstrong.com">business school applications</a>, I&#8217;ve got next to no free time, we&#8217;re going to do this one room at a time. First room: the living room.</p>


<p><img src="/images/house/livingroom/lookingsouth.jpg" alt="looking into a room, a couch, a coffee table, a gas heater on one wall, pictures hung on others, an open window, a cockatoo on a perch" />
The only real downside here is that the gas heater on the far wall is the only source of heat for the whole place.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not a big home entertaiment center kind of guy, but I&#8217;ve got to have my TV and cable. Best of all, the laptop&#8217;s got wireless Internet thanks to my AirPort.<br />
<img src="/images/house/livingroom/lookingeast.jpg" alt="coffee table in the foreground with laptop and poinsetta on it, tv on a shelf unit, coats on coathooks, and an entrance into another room" /></p>

<p>If you&#8217;re ready to leave already, here&#8217;s the door:<br />
<img src="/images/house/livingroom/lookingnorth.jpg" alt="the front door, the bird on the perch, a comfy chair and ottoman, a skinny metallic Ikea lamp" /></p>

<p>The view out the front window ain&#8217;t great, but at least I&#8217;ve got a tree:<br />
<img src="/images/house/livingroom/frontwindow.jpg" alt="looking out a window, a tree in the foreground, a fence and an apartment building in the background" />
That tree grows like a mother and I have to keep it clipped back!</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the first room. Gripping, ain&#8217;t it? More rooms to follow.</p>
