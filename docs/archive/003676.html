				<p>Waiting in line to check out my new book, I realized I&#8217;d forgotten to bring back the overdue book that I owed. Checking in my pocket, I only had a few Mexican coins &#8212; two large five-peso coins, a small three-peso coin, two tiny two-peso coins, and a medum-sized one peso coin. She&#8217;d take them.</p>

<p>When I got to the front of the line, I held a slip of paper with a stamped-on bar code under a scanner; the red laser made an x over the stamp and the librarian read out the name of the book I wanted to check out as it appeared on her screen: &#8220;The Empire Strikes Back. Will that be all for you?&#8221; I replied yes &#8212; I knew that, in this library, she&#8217;d scan the request card for the book and the bearded, portly, black-t-shirted librarian standing behind her with the small basket would go back into the stacks and pull the requests of the last few customers.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003676.html#fn1">1</a></sup> &#8220;You have a $1 fine. Would you like to pay it?&#8221;<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003676.html#fn2">2</a></sup> I said yes, and handed her one two-peso coin. &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; she said, and my debt was settled; then she gave some advice to the people in line behind me. &#8220;You know, these two-peso coins are great, use them to pay any police fines you get in Mexico. They&#8217;ll count them the same as a one-peso coin but the police will like you a lot better.&#8221;</p>

<p>I moved past the librarian&#8217;s checkout counter and waited for the portly librarian to return with my book. He came back in a few minutes, with a basket full of books. Paperbacks came off, then a couple of hardcovers, and my book at the bottom. But was it my book? It looked like a box with a great Star Wars-themed cover&#8230; and, opening it, it was an assembly-required Death Star playset, Stormtroopers included.</p>

<p>This was bad. I had to head for the airport to get on vacation in two hours. I still had to eat lunch &#8212; no time to walk anywhere, I&#8217;d have to drive somewhere &#8212; and I had to pack, and what was I to read on said vacation? The playset was cool &#8212; I could spend hours with it &#8212; but it wouldn&#8217;t do well on the beach.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Just like the late, unlamented <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Products">Best</a></p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> I do in fact owe the library about $0.40. Also, some asshole put a hold on the book I&#8217;m 1/3 done with. I think I have to give up on it; hold wars are futile for everyone involved. Can anybody recommend a good, sparely-written, Western?</p>
