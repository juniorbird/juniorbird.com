				<p>I will never publicly admit that I like having 8am classes four days in a row. But I am now officially a convert to the whole morning person things. A flurry of e-mails at 6:05am? Makes me feel hardcore.</p>

<p>Like my mother, also a Cancer, I used to heart sleeping in. I think I made it in at 8:45am &#8212; official starting time &#8212; about 5% of the time at my last job. Earlier, when I owned my own business, I&#8217;d regularly keep going &#8216;til 11 or midnight and then sleep &#8216;til 8am (thank goodness I worked from home and a quick trip downstairs in my jammies had me answering e-mails by the time clients got into work). I vowed I would never, ever, work for someone who made me come in before 9:30am. Ahh, youth.</p>

<p>When I started school in August I saw all the first-term 8am classes I was, to put it lightly, I was ready to plotz. And the first couple of weeks were awful; I never drank a lot of coffee before, but suddenly I was up to a venti soy latte every morning. Then I started getting headaches when I skipped coffee, so I downshifted to tea (and baked goods!), and got my mornings going.</p>

<p>Today I woke up at 5:30 &#8212; even before the alarm went off &#8212; and sat down and did some research. Forty pages of analyst Spanish- and Portuguese-language analyst reports and business press articles later, I discovered I was done with my research for the day, even before my first class.</p>

<p>The downside of all of this is that I keep waking up at unreasonable hours like 5:15am. This is even worse thanks to <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/001421.html">daylight savings time</a>, since the light by which I might have gotten my work done has been transferred, by government fiat, to midwestern industrial agriculture. Soon I may have to switch my alarm from 6am to 5:30am &#8212; and, if Dean Voigt lets me, I might actually try to get to sleep before one. Because, let&#8217;s face it, that hour between midnight and one is just all about the recently-TiVoed Family Guy and Futurama. I need less cartoon in my life and more hardcore 6am e-mailing.</p>
