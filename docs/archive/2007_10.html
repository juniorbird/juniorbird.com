							<h3>Dear Jennifer Lopez</h3>

							<h3>Luck Favors the Prepared</h3>
							<p class="date">Oct 25, 2007 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_elsewhere.html">Elsewhere</a></p>
							
							<p>Nothing ever goes right for my neighbor. His tires are flat, someone broke his cabinet (the one that he left in the driveway), and his car accidentally got impounded. The things he hopes for never pan out. For Steve Jobs, <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/10/22results.htm">it&#8217;s the opposite story</a> - Apple sold a boatload of Macs last quarter, more than anyone expected. It seems like, after years of hoping, Steve finally got some iPod users to make the big switch to the Mac.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/luck_favors_the_prepared.php">Read on&#8230;</a>
						
									
				
					
				
							<h3>The Smell, or Something of Fear</h3>

							<p>The <span class="caps">AIG </span>and I went to a Haunted House last weekend. It was kind of a lark &#8212; we were having a night on the town, walking down the street, and there was an empty ticket line for a haunted house. Seemed rather season-appropriate, so we went in. And then the <span class="caps">AIG </span>shivered in anticipated fear as we made our way to the head of the line to get in, and screamed her way through the (admittedly very well-done) haunted house. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003539.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>What Do Pets Do at Night?</h3>

							<p>The <span class="caps">AIG </span>has this wonderful little dog &#8212; let&#8217;s call him Seamus. Seamus is pretty much Perfect Dog &#8212; friendly, respectful, cuddly, well-behaved, slobber-free, possessed of incredible bladder control &#8212; but he&#8217;s also got these soulful eyes. And, if he has one weakness, it&#8217;s his stinginess with kisses. So, when he woke us with kisses this morning, and deep, downcast brown eyes, the question was: what happened to the poor thing last night&#8217;s treats and cozy climbing under the covers and this morning&#8217;s plaintive paean for approval? <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003525.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I&#8217;m prematurely aged. Or, at least I am if you look at the ads on the TV I watch. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Mint">Franklin Mint</a>? Check. <a href="http://hoverounddirect.com/hoveround/unique/98149.php">Hoveround</a>? Check. Good times, good times.

							<h3>Top 6 Small Business Web Site Mistakes</h3>
							<p class="date">Oct  5, 2007 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_elsewhere.html">Elsewhere</a></p>
							
							<p>In a former life, I designed Web sites for a living &#8212; I still do a bit of consulting here and there. For someone starting a new business, having a great Web site can make a big difference. But it&#8217;s not always clear how to make a site that really sells online. Here are some common mistakes that companies of all sizes make on their Web sites, as well as some tips and tools you can use to make sure these mistakes don&#8217;t appear on your site.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/entrepreneurship/top_6_small_business_web_site_mistakes.php">Read on&#8230;</a>
