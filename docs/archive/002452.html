				<p>Thank you for providing me with that little shot of adrenalin this morning; it was a rainy, dismal morning, and I was a little groggy. Seeing you speed through the red light, and feeling my car skid just a bit as I slammed on the breaks in the wet street, stopping just feet from you, certainly got me going at peak alertness. I hope that I didn&#8217;t disrupt your cell phone conversation too much when I laid on my horn while coming to a complete stop (said action was refreshingly reflexive).</p>

<p>I will freely admit that it was probably better for me than for you that we didn&#8217;t get in a wreck, since your big four-door Suburban is much larger than my Lexus. While I&#8217;m expressing my gratitude, I do think that I should help you get in contact with the person who prevented me from t-boning you right on the driver&#8217;s side door at 35mph; specifically, that nutcase in the white <span class="caps">F250 </span>with four feet of metal piping sticking out of the bed.</p>

<p>You see, just a half a block before I entered the intersection which you were, simultaneously, entering, I had to dodge this fine individual in his big truck as he entered Venice from a parking lot and cut across three lanes to get into the left turn lane. Now, we&#8217;ve all done this, but this driver executed the maneuver with such &eacute;lan, in order to get in the back of the rather long line at the turn signal, he actually drove towards oncoming traffic for about 20 feet, then popped a quick u-ey to get in the queue. Naturally, seeing this large, white truck heading straight for me, I slowed, and I kept my speed down since the length of pipe protruding from the end of the truck blocked another 3/4 of a lane. Had I not gotten down to about 20mph from the 35 I was doing, I would assuredly have hit you, or beaten you into the intersection and been t-boned by you.</p>

<p>And, as we can both agree, the value of your unexpected transit of the intersection was really the morning pick-me-up it provided for both of us, in the form of an adrenaline boost. Well, at any rate, you provided that for me; since you just kept going and kept talking on your cell phone, this may have been just a normal, relaxing, every morning activity for you. I guess that would explain the very large vehicle; always better to have Newton on your side.</p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>Wade</p>

<p>Just thought the detail might add some flavor.</p>
