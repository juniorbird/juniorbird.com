							<h3>Official 2009 Holiday Computer Program Buyer's Guide</h3>

							<p>It&#8217;s coming down to crunch time if you&#8217;re celebrating Christmas. Nothing&#8217;s better for last-minute gifts than software &#8212; you can just download it, burn the installer to a <span class="caps">CD, </span>and slip that in the ol&#8217; stocking. You don&#8217;t even need to leave the house and brave the parking garage (unless you need to go to Best Buy to grab some blank CDs, that is!). But the question is: what do you get the geek who has everything? Or, worse, what do you get the ordinary person who doesn&#8217;t care what they run on their computer? Well, everything below is cool in the way that getting things you do everyday done easier and quicker is cool. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003878.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>There's No Place Like Homepage For The Holidays</h3>
							<p class="date">Dec 13, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_otherwise_uncategorized.html">Otherwise Uncategorized</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Two years ago I introduced the Juniorbird.com t-shirts; they&#8217;re back this year, the same classic designs on new, great shirt options, for your last-minute holiday shopping needs. That&#8217;s right, if you like the somewhat-snappy textual stylings you&#8217;ve seen here on Juniorbird.com, you can now carry them with you all day long, on your chest, where all one&#8217;s opinions and feelings should be worn. (It&#8217;s better than on your sleeve.) <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003881.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Best Buy Experts' Christmas Gift To Me: Good Service!</h3>
							<p class="date">Dec 12, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_reviews.html">Reviews</a></p>
						    	
							<p>You know what I don&#8217;t expect at Best Buy? Great customer service. You know what I just got at Best Buy? Really great customer service. Great like, they changed it from from &#8220;I&#8217;ll never buy a computer here again&#8221; bad situation to &#8220;I&#8217;ll always buy my computers here in the future.&#8221;  Following in <a href="http://auros.livejournal.com/306423.html">Auros&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://auros.livejournal.com/304982.html">footsteps</a>, the Christmasy things to do seems to be to blog about it. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003880.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Official 2009 Holiday Photography Buyer's Guide</h3>

							<p>Occasionally someone compliments my <a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com">photography</a>. Misguided though such a sentiment may be, there are a few specific items that I would recommend anyone interested in taking better shots buy. Since it&#8217;s the holiday season, why not help yourself to one of these?<br />

							<h3>Two and a Half Clooneys</h3>
							<p class="date">Dec  6, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_reviews.html">Reviews</a></p>
						    	
							<p>If you say &#8220;1980s movie character archetype,&#8221; maybe you come up with John Rambo, or Ferris Bueller, or Charlie Sheen in <em>Wall Street</em> &#8212; America kicking ass, America growing up, America getting rich &#8212; but the ultimate character archetype of the &#8217;80s for me is someone with a lot less hair, a lot more coiled rage, a lot more cool. Let&#8217;s face it, the &#8217;80s were all about Louis Gossett Jr.  And the &#8217;90s, for every Brad Pitt or tight-lipped Robert Pattinson, there&#8217;s the standard: all the cool, none of the rage, it&#8217;s George Clooney. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003879.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Official 2009 Holiday Kitchen Buyer's Guide</h3>
							<p class="date">Dec  3, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_food.html">Food</a>, <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_otherwise_uncategorized.html">Otherwise Uncategorized</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I like to cook. You may have <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_food.html">read</a>. Any chef loves their gadgets, and, being a geek, I do so more than most. While I do tend to think that the solution to almost any problem is technology, I don&#8217;t like to keep things around that don&#8217;t really, really work. Since it&#8217;s the holiday season, and that means getting stuff for both of the major world religions of which I am a member, here are a few such gadgets I suggest you put on your wish list this year. For your online shopping convenience, I&#8217;ve included links to buy all these goodies at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F&amp;tag=wadearmstrong-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">Amazon</a>, which incidentally gives a smidge of the price of your purchase to me, at no cost to you. I&#8217;ve also tried to pick reasonably-priced entry-level options, for particular holiday season. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003877.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
