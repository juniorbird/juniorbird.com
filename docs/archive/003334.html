				<p>Many of those who live in the <a href="http://www.palms-california.us/staticpages/index.php?page=20051125145006742%23Anchor-CHARNOCK-37516">Charnock Ranch Historic Business Area</a> apparently have no particular job; I see them gadding about every mid-day and every afternoon. Of course, if I had anything to do myself, then I wouldn&#8217;t be out to see my neighbors, but that&#8217;s not the point of this blog entry. The point is that these obviously unemployed people &#8212; unkempt, nappy-haired, filthy-clothed, pockmarked, hollow-cheeked, pinpointed pupils &#8212; have a lot more going on, cash flow-wise, than I had expected.</p>

<p>The other day I saw an older, stooped gentleman with a mountain man beard and a brown fitted corduroy jacket and a light green t-shirt covered with the pinprick holes that moths make. He paid for his coffee in quarters and nickels but under his arm was a Wall Street Journal and a large envelope marked &#8220;your statements enclosed.&#8221; Perhaps he was one of those eccentrics who live an ascetic life and leave behind millions? Or perhaps those were his neighbor&#8217;s statements. From the directionless shuffle that brought this man around the corner, I suspect the latter.</p>

<p>Then there was the guy I saw crossing the street. He was dressed all skater-punk but, let&#8217;s face it, his clothes were about five years old and stiff and faded from having been washed maybe a dozen times in that period. I couldn&#8217;t see the pupils in his baby blue eyes. But he walked purposefully across the street, and under his arm he held the entrepreneurial manifesto <a href="http://amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591840562/ref=nosim/wadearmstrong-20">The Art of the Start</a>. I wonder: what&#8217;s a guy like this starting?</p>

<p>Perhaps I should take lessons. There&#8217;s people like this all around my neighborhood, with no particular evidence of a means of support, but every day they keep going. There must be a trick to it, and I aim to find out.</p>
