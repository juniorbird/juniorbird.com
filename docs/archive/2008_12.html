							<h3>Drink of the Month: The L'il Bit</h3>
							<p class="date">Dec  7, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_drink_of_the_month.html">Drink of the Month</a></p>
						    	
							<p>One of the finest drinks out there is the Martini. I&#8217;m not talking about the modern version, ordered by the sleek and hip in clubs and bars out there, which is nothing but a triple shot of very cold vodka; I&#8217;m talking about a proper Martini, with enough Vermouth to provide, you know, flavor. But sometimes that Martini&#8217;s just too harsh, and you want something a little fruity &#8212; not too sweet, just a little fruity. That&#8217;s the L&#8217;il Bit. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003782.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Not Exactly Networking</h3>

							<p>I should&#8217;ve known when I missed the first turn to the <a href="https://mymarshall.usc.edu/mems/user/registerEvent.jsp?activity=getEventById&amp;eventId=1053">Marshall Alumni Holiday Reception</a> and my next four chances to turn around were blocked off by <span class="caps">LAPD </span>auto and bike officers that things did not look good. But I drove around the northern half of Downtown and finally managed to get headed in the right direction to park and head into the event.<br />

							<h3>We Mean Business: Wagville</h3>
							<p class="date">Dec  2, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_elsewhere.html">Elsewhere</a></p>
							
							<p><a href="http://wagville.com">Wagville</a> is a Los Angeles doggie boarding and day care facility founded and run by Harvard grad and former lawyer <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/ppl/webprofile?id=18152133">Julie Shine</a>. Like the other <span class="caps"><span class="caps">WMB </span></span>subjects, Wagville isn&#8217;t making enough money. We quickly learn that:</p>


<ul>
<li>The company does little to no retail business, despite having a large (and cluttered) storefront</li>
<li>Check-in takes minutes on a slow system</li>
<li>There are no facilities for people, just for the dogs</li>
<li>Employees are unmotivated and ill-tempered</li>
<li>Julie cannot motivate staff and may be a micromanager</li>
<li>There are 27 employees in a business that&#8217;s caring for no more than 60 dogs at any time, and the costs add up - in one month, Wagville did $90,000 in sales but had $65,000 in payroll and so couldn&#8217;t make a profit</li>
<li>Julie is focused on providing a service to dogs, not on making profit</li>
<li>Julie is carrying crushing credit card debt in order to keep the place running</li>
</ul>
