				<p>Today was an interesting day, a day that offered me a unique range of the experiences avaialable at business school. Or &#8212; in another way to look at it &#8212; I got to build up my bad karma, then reap the rewards.</p>

<p>So today Toastmasters had a big outside speaker. I&#8217;d done publicity (poorly), planning (well, remarkably), and people were there! And the speaker was there! And the room we&#8217;d reserved a month ago was there! And there were people in the room! From Del Monte! To recruit students! And I accidentally told them off! Thus the bad karma.</p>

<p>But I was super-nice to the scheduling people, and we had a new room in fifteen minutes. And the speech was great. Everyone loved it, and they learned from it, and I would have too, except I stepped out to get the speaker&#8217;s gift (I was going to get it before the speech, but spent that time trying to find a new room instead), and, when I returned, found myself locked out. I was let back in by a kind savior about 2/3 of the way into the speech.</p>

<p>Then, for the afternoon, I skipped class to write a paper, a paper that should have taken 90 minutes but somehow managed to take 3 hours. Still, I learned a lot writing it.</p>

<p>But my comeuppance was still to, um, come. Remember that class I skipped? Well, there I was, typing away in the courtyard, and along comes the professor. Apparently he saw me and asked my supposed friends &#8220;hey, should I go over and talk to him?&#8221; They said yes! So he came over, we discussed my absence, I promised to attend next week and participate fully (I usually participate, so I thought I could get a freebie). He seemed skeptical. But I had been punished, at least a little, for yelling at Del Monte.</p>

<p>Actually, I still feel bad about it. I might pass on a message to them through the Career Center. I&#8217;m a bad Trojan!</p>
