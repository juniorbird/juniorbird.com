				<p>After some obsessing, I&#8217;ve decided not to fly to Raleigh-Durham and try to get off the <a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/000386.html">Kenan-Flagler waitlist</a>. It&#8217;s really because of <a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/000390.html">my visit to <span class="caps">NYU</span></a> that I&#8217;m doing this.</p>
				
				<p>I&#8217;ve been in Southern California, more or less happily, for the last ten years. I applied to <span class="caps">NYU </span>and <span class="caps">UNC </span>as two entirely different opportunities to get out of town and try something new. If I get in, I may indeed choose to go to New York for a change; it would be good to cross against the light have access to actual public transportation.</p>

<p>But what I loved about New York were its urban charms. I liked the big city full of opportunities and undercut by tunnels through which I could rush to said opportunities. I liked 4-, 5-, and more-story buildings. And if that&#8217;s what I liked, I&#8217;m not sure that bucolic Raleigh-Durham is for me.</p>

<p>And besides, while Stern has pledged to make its decision by the end of this month, Kenan-Flagler won&#8217;t tell me if I&#8217;m in off the wait list until mid-May. By then, I&#8217;ll have had to give my yea or nay to Marshall, and if I gave <span class="caps">USC </span>the thumbs down at this point it would be to give the thumbs up to <span class="caps">NYU.</span></p>
