							<p><span class="caps">OK,</span> I&#8217;ve been fooling around on my new PowerBook &#8212; I mean, MacBook &#8212; now for a couple weeks, and I&#8217;ve achieved a moderate level of productivity. But what are the great apps out there that I&#8217;m missing? What small developer should get my $30 for the magic they&#8217;ll put in my Applications folder?

							<p>Well, I went and did it. I got a 15&#8221; <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MacBook Pro</a> to replace my Dell. The new Mac was supposed to come in more of the April/May timeframe, but then the Dell had a little explosion &#8212; a flash of light, an overpowering smell of ozone, and then it wouldn&#8217;t turn on for two days (remarkably, after a weekend turned off, the Dell worked fine). That put a crimp in my plans for productivity and whatnot, and I couldn&#8217;t quite trust a sparky laptop, so MacBook Pro time it was. And it&#8217;s wonderful. It&#8217;s beautiful. It feels great, and I love it. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003583.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
