				<p>This is what bothers me about Obamacare&#8217;s individual mandate probably being struck down by <span class="caps">SCOTUS </span>in their next session:</p><p>Obamacare is a plan in which privately-practicing physicians treat patients who privately select them, in a privately-owned environment, for which they are privately paid, by insurance which these patients have privately bought. </p><p>I believe in the power of the government to do great things that we are incapable of doing individually. But I also believe that the market can inspire us to do creative, revolutionary things. I can also see the evidence that healthcare systems with large private components - France, Switzerland, Singapore - seem to return great results at moderate costs. While the idea of a mandate to purchase a product makes me philosophically uncomfortable, the result seems just what I&#8217;m looking for - and meaningfully about certain kinds of personal freedom and business competitiveness too. </p><p>But we&#8217;re not getting that system. And that means that we&#8217;ll continue with this current set-up that costs a ton, delivers only-okay results, reduces personal freedom, and imposes vast costs that bankrupt individuals and corporations, holding back our national competitiveness. </p><p>That, obviously, can&#8217;t stand. But get rid of a couple of those &#8220;privates&#8221; in my second para and the rest are untenable and irrelevant. And that means, with market-oriented solutions like Obamacare and Hillarycare off the table, we&#8217;re headed for the thing the right fears most: British-style state-owned and -operated healthcare. </p><p>Oh well, at least it delivers fairly good results at an extremely low cost. </p><p>But this is what bothers me about our conservatives: by offering no solution except what we have now, they&#8217;re limiting the paths future solutions can take, while opening no new directions. They&#8217;re like Russian boyars, resisting the end of the czar&#8217;s rule and theor own social privilege, dooming themselves to an end in front of a Red firing squad, unlike the landed gentry of Britain, giving up their traditional perquisites and power in return for Empire.</p>
