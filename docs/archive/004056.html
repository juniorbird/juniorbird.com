				<p>The hardest blog entry for a trip is always the first one: there&#8217;s not much to write about, as travel is boring (if you&#8217;re doing it right); and then there&#8217;s jet lag, which saps all the faculties, mental most of all. Between those factors, it&#8217;s hard to get much out at all. But I&#8217;m in Paris, which provides a level of inspiration all its own, so I&#8217;ll give it the old college try.</p><p>The flight, which was actually quite nice, was direct from <span class="caps">LAX </span>to Paris, on Air France. Their food is all it&#8217;s cracked up to be, by the way, and their in-flight movies are no slouch either; I caught <em>Invictus</em> and <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1179025/" target="_blank">Les Aventures Extraordinaires d&#8217;Adele Blanc-Sec</a></em> (to practice my French&#8230; and also for fun!). Mrs. DJ L&#8217;il Bit saw <em>Brothers</em>. I bested my record for fastest-falling-asleep-on-an-airplane by nodding off during the takeoff roll, which annoyed my wife &#8212; who is one of those people that struggle to get any shut-eye at all during a flight &#8212; vastly, inspiring several rolls of her extremely large, green eyes.</p><p>When we landed, she got a makeover while I waited for the luggage. For some reason, the airport authority had a stand for a chair massage, haircut, or makeover right by baggage claim. Everybody looks a big worn after a long flight, but, thanks to this unexpected service, she arrived at our hotel looking great. Immigration was easy, too, although I couldn&#8217;t see any speed advantage between her new <span class="caps">RFID</span>-tagged passport and my older one.</p><p>Really, the worst part of the travel was the stop-and-go traffic that our cab had to brave to get us to <a href="http://www.hotelparislenoxsaintgermain.com/" target="_blank">our hotel</a>. And how bad is it when a cab takes you to a place that looks like this?</p><p><a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/France-2010/Paris/12779801_Epyu8#921118557_RaFL5-A-LB" target="_blank"><img src="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/France-2010/Paris/IMG2326/921118557_RaFL5-M.jpg"/></a></p><p><a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/France-2010/Paris/12779801_Epyu8#921100540_9nbcE-A-LB" target="_blank"><img src="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/France-2010/Paris/IMG2300/921100540_9nbcE-M.jpg"/></a></p><p><a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/France-2010/Paris/12779801_Epyu8#921108826_ygGdr-A-LB" target="_blank"><img src="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/France-2010/Paris/IMG2313/921108826_ygGdr-M.jpg"/></a></p><p><a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/France-2010/Paris/12779801_Epyu8#921121511_YJKZm-A-LB" target="_blank"><img src="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/France-2010/Paris/P1000020/921121511_YJKZm-M.jpg"/></a></p><p>So, a brasserie lunch and a sidewalk cafe dinner later &#8212; that&#8217;s steak frites ftw, as the kids say these days, folks &#8212; we&#8217;re settling into our hotel room and awaiting tomorrow&#8217;s promised rain, which should drop the temperature from the 90s to the low 80s and make this a very walkable city for us.</p>
