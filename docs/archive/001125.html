				<p>If you knew me, you&#8217;d know the way to my heart is through my stomach; and, if you knew me, you&#8217;d know I&#8217;d never date a woman about whom you couldn&#8217;t say the same thing. And what&#8217;s better than a shared love? So, no prix fixe menu at a packed 21-Food-score-on-Zagat restaurant for me and my Wonderful Girlfriend; instead, our big Valentine&#8217;s Day event was a <a href="http://www.cmiregistration.com/user/org/program.jxp?org=287&amp;id=22015">cooking class for couples</a> at Sur La Table.</p>

<p><span class="caps">OK, </span>a little more background. Since both me and the little woman are in school, we don&#8217;t eat out as much as before, and we don&#8217;t get to spend as much quality time together as before. Cooking together has been a natural outgrowth of these limitations, so this class seemed natural.</p>

<p>The menu was pretty snazzy &#8212; an appetizer of tomato jelly on toast with goat cheese, followed by a roast pork loin, green beans, root vegetable puree, and, for dessert, an individual chocolate souffle. The program promised that we&#8217;d cook all of this in 3 hours, which we did, with time left over for a little shopping!</p>

<p>We worked at a table with three other couples, and we all shared wines and cooked together on a meal for the table. I was amused to see that each of the three tables of couples was determined to finish each task first and &#8220;win&#8221;. I was also impressed that, food or not, this was a thin, good-looking group. Wine tastes were also pretty good, with one couple bringing a bottle of Pinotage they&#8217;d smuggled back from a vacation to South Africa.</p>

<p><span class="caps">OK, </span>back to the food. The first course was, as I said earlier, toast with goat cheese and tomato jelly. This was an incredible dish, both in taste and in ease of making. The trick: rub a clove of garlic across the toast before putting the cheese and jelly on it!</p>

<p>The pork loins were wonderful just to look at, and, because they were so small, cooked up in no time. The first step was to trim off the silver skin:<br />

<p>Next step was to sear the meat and make a sauce of the <em>fond</em>:<br />

<p>The final result was impressive:<br />

<p>The side dishes were incredible, especially the green beans, which we cooked with lardons. It&#8217;s amazing how much flavor these little bacon-like strips add.<br />
<img src="/images/surlatable/veggiesandwine.jpg" /></p>

<p><span class="caps">OK, </span>we&#8217;re a little short on the pics here, but, hey, I was busy cooking, drinking wine, eating, and actually interacting with others! Give a brother a break, man!</p>

<p>We were both sold on the class, and we&#8217;ll be signing up for others. The chef also did a good job of selling us on a couple of tools that we used to cook (a zester and a chocolate breaker). Too bad that they didn&#8217;t do the same with knives; we used some beautiful-looking asian hammered-steel knives that, sadly, were as blunt as my first-grade scissors. Another great merchandising opportunity lost!</p>

<p>But we couldn&#8217;t have had a more fun, more romantic night. Book now for next year! We&#8217;ll see you there!</p>

                    <p>did you make the tomato jelly or open a jar?<br />
I can&#8217;t believe you didn&#8217;t already have a zester!<br />
&#8230; and WTF is a chocolate breaker?<br />
Sounds like you guys had fun, though!  Yay!</p>

                    <p>Made the tomato jelly. It was easy as anything!</p>

<p>I guess I don&#8217;t always zest as much as I might, but I will think about it now, especially with all the muffins I&#8217;m making.</p>

<p>A chocolate breaker &#8212; I bet I&#8217;m getting the name wrong &#8212; is like four triangular pointy things on a flat piece of metal at the end of a long handle. It looks like an evil potato masher. It breaks chocolate up into tiny chunks.</p>
