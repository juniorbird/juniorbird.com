				<p>What goes on a blog? It&#8217;s tempting to say &#8220;whatever I like.&#8221; But this is not true; the medium is a public one. Thus, content has to pass a kind of &#8220;smell test&#8221; &#8212; is what I write appropriate for <em>everybody</em>?  Is it appropriate for those whom I know read the site? Is it appropriate for those whom I don&#8217;t know read the site? Is it appropriate for strangers? Is it appropriate for people who find this site through Google in five years?</p>

<p>In an entry I made a few days ago, the content was only appropriate (or useful) for a few ears. There was no reason it should&#8217;ve been on a public site. Why did I publish it? Well, a whole bunch of reasons, but reasons can become excuses and excuses aren&#8217;t useful.</p>

<p>So: I apologize to those about whom I wrote negatively a few days ago. I should not have impugned you in a public area, and I certainly should not have done so without talking to you first, offline, y&#8217;know, like folks have done for 30,000 years now. Now that I&#8217;ve talked to you, it&#8217;s clear that I was given incorrect information and based my opinions upon that. So not only was I wrong to write about what I felt, I shouldn&#8217;t have felt it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve deleted the entry, as I no longer believe it ever should have been in a public blog. Where does this leave juniorbird.com? Same place it was before. The abovementioned content was an unexpected topic to add to this site, and I don&#8217;t think there is a need for me to have a place to express the kinds of feelings I wrote about then. I&#8217;ve got happy, interesting content that I can mostly fill the site with. Well, not so much today, because today I woke up to Governor Schwarzenegger. But there will be jolly, amusing content other days.</p>
