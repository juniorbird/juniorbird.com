				<p>Are you thinking of a <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/001587.html">summer internship in or temporary relocation to Arizona</a>? Think twice, it’s dangerous. Interns and others who choose to temporarily relocate to Arizona, or any of the other Western desert states may find themselves catching Valley Fever. I think I did! Your temporary relocation to, or internship in, Arizona could feature the substantial downsiede of weeks of coughs, fatigue, and worse.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m exaggerating, of course. Valley Fever&#8217;s not that dangerous. But I am a little bummed out &#8212; I got a nasty cold in Brazil, finally got rid of the leftover cough, and, suddenly, after a nice little wind and storm, apparently my lungs are filled with fungus, and I have a cough that won&#8217;t quit. My roommate, who&#8217;s worked around healthcare for quite a while, thinks it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.astdhpphe.org/infect/valley.html">Valley Fever</a>. <a href="http://phoenix.about.com/cs/health/a/valleyfever01.htm">Valley Fever</a> is <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/health/wellness/articles/0830valleyfever31.html">very common in Phoenix</a>,  and is usually non-serious &#8212; many people don&#8217;t even develop symptoms. But, last year, 24 people died of Valley Fever in the Phoenix area, and in the above-linked <span class="caps">AZC</span>entral article, there&#8217;s the story of a woman whose spine bones were eaten away by the fungus! That&#8217;s scary.</p>

<p>So that nice, productive cough is one symptom, and it&#8217;s not so bad except for being annoying and for making people stand several feet away from me since they think I have TB or something. Another symptom is, apparently, swelling within the joints, which explains why my <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/000026.html">plantar fasciitis</a> has unexpectedly come back. Ouch! However, I&#8217;m sure I look stylin&#8217; in my white-and-purple running shoes that provide so much support and that fit my orthotics with space to spare. Also, fortunately, it&#8217;s too hot to walk much.</p>

<p>To be clear, I don&#8217;t hate Phoenix at all. I just find this, and <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/001587.html">the requirement that interns or temporary workers in Arizona become residents</a>, to be particularly amusing.</p>
