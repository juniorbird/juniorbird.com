				<p>A lot of words have been spent talking about the quality, or lack thereof, of <em>300</em>, the new movie based on a Frank Miller graphic novel. I&#8217;m probably not going to add to the overall value or quality of all of that here. However, if King Leonidas and his Spartans didn&#8217;t mind dying for nothing, then I can&#8217;t see why I should mind blogging for nothing.</p>

<p><em>300</em> is the adaptation of the graphic novel of the same name, by Frank Miller of <em>Sin City</em> fame, about the battle of Thermopylae,<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003179.html#fn1">1</a></sup> at which the Spartans fought the invading Persians. I leave it up to your fourth-grade history teacher to bring you up-to-date on what happened in that battle. <em>300</em> is probably a generally more-or-less accurate description of this battle. <em>300</em> is also a very accurate adaptation of the graphic novel &#8212; like <em>Sin City</em>, the movie is shot scene-for-scene to duplicate the art in the graphic novel, and a limited color palette, incorporating extensive digital imagery.</p>

<p><em>300</em> is also a pretty good movie. It&#8217;s got everything you expect from an adaptation of a Frank Miller graphic novel, including:</p>


<ul>
<li>Great colors</li>
<li>Minimal but expressive scenes</li>
<li>Substantial blood &amp; gore</li>
<li>Archetypical, almost pulp-y characters, executed with a Dashiell Hammett-like edge</li>
<li>Boobies</li>
</ul>



<p>That&#8217;s really what it comes down to &#8212; <em>300</em> makes a specific promise, in its concept and its trailers, and it delivers on that completely. <em>300</em> is not the greatest movie you&#8217;ll ever see. It&#8217;s not the most positive towards women, and it&#8217;s definitely not the most positive towards non-Western people.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003179.html#fn2">2</a></sup> It&#8217;s fun. It&#8217;s violent &#8212; you&#8217;d better like flying limbs and great gouts of blood shooting all over<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003179.html#fn3">3</a></sup> (in fact, the closing credits are all about the animated gouts of blood).</p>

<p><em>300</em> is hypermasculine, too; you know how very manly things from the &#8217;50s are now perceived as super-gay? Well all of the perfect six-packs and bulging pecs and sweaty, bare arms and leather bikini-style outfits in this movie will probably come off as super-gay at some time in the future too. At least, I hope that they are perceived as gay, because, as a straight guy, I can say I will never have a body that good, and I hope nobody ever expects it of me.</p>

<p>But, to get away from my own insecurities and back to <em>300</em>: it was a pretty film for more than just pretty men. A lot has been said about <em>300</em>&#8217;s unique look, and I have to say I&#8217;m all for it. Movies have, for years, used scenes with limited color palettes to set a mood, or to make certain things stand out; with digital technology, directors don&#8217;t have to accept whatever color the grass where they choose to shoot. In some cases, this is a good thing.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003179.html#fn4">4</a></sup> I&#8217;m sure it can also be used for evil. But the look of the movie added greatly to how it worked, and digital animation allowed a lot of scenes and levels of violence to exist that otherwise could not have. Overall, I have to say, <em>300</em> reminded me of a play &#8212; very few grand vistas, very few locations, much more focus on the players than the scenery. It worked.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s what it comes down to: it worked. <em>300</em> simply delivered exactly what should have been expected of it, and that&#8217;s rare these days. Too many movies claim to be the big action thriller of the summer, or the cute romance, but fall down on script or acting or overall execution; <em>300</em> makes a simple, limited promise, and delivers well. If this movie&#8217;s previews aren&#8217;t appealing, if you don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d like that look or that amount of violence or whatever, then skip it. If you think all the above sounds like a fun ride to you, then go for it. </p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> It&#8217;s actually handy if you know this beforehand</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> Although, overall, there is little enough character development in the non-Spartan characters for them to be more than a crude stereotype of some form anyway. I&#8217;ll be honest that, from a race point of view, I was more disturbed by the large number of blue-eyed Ancient Greeks in this movie; if we&#8217;re representing people as they are, then Greeks should be dark-eyed and swarthy, for starters.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn3"><sup>3</sup> To be an apologist again, if you hack off a limb, I would imagine said severance is followed by at least a brief fountain of blood from the busily-pumping arteries. As I&#8217;ve managed to miss de-limbings so far, I wouldn&#8217;t know for sure.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn4"><sup>4</sup> However, were I cast in this movie, I&#8217;d be pissed that I spent my whole time in a soundstage rather than in Greece.</p>

<p>Speaking of&#8230; here is a review from a friend of mine in the bay area.  Compare and contrast.  <br />
