							<h3>Dear Paramount</h3>

							<p>Thanks for licensing <em>It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life</em> exclusively to <span class="caps">NBC.</span> I&#8217;d become somewhat complacent, watching the same movie every Christmas eve (sometimes several times! Thanks, <span class="caps">UHF </span>stations!). Fortunately, you broke me out of that rut; without your intervention, I never would&#8217;ve watched <a href="http://www.blackathlete.net/Boxing/boxing111803.html">Holyfield-Bowe <span class="caps">III</span></a> on <span class="caps">ESPN</span> Classic. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003601.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Earlier today, as I was shopping in the <span class="caps">HEB </span>with my parents, I found myself overcome with the season. Well, not so much with the season as with the music. I&#8217;ve been without my music since I came to Houston, although, technically, that&#8217;s only because I&#8217;m too stubborn to listen to Pandora without my good speakers plugged in. Anyway, the carols playing over the <span class="caps">HEB&#8217;</span>s PA system put a smile on my face, and suddenly I was singing along. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003599.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>The night Rick died, his ex called me in the middle of the night to tell me. But her voicemail was unintelligible; and I was already up. I&#8217;d been up for an hour, and I&#8217;d spent that whole time in terror. Because I was sure he was coming to get me.<br />

Can you believe that Brit&#8217;s mom was going to write <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pop-Culture-Mom-Family-Tabloid/dp/1595551565/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1198096511&amp;sr=8-1">a book on how to raise a celeb family</a>?  <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003594.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>The 0-13 Dolphins are now 1-13 &#8212; they beat my hapless Ravens.

							<p><span class="caps">OK,</span> I&#8217;ve been fooling around on my new PowerBook &#8212; I mean, MacBook &#8212; now for a couple weeks, and I&#8217;ve achieved a moderate level of productivity. But what are the great apps out there that I&#8217;m missing? What small developer should get my $30 for the magic they&#8217;ll put in my Applications folder? Tell me your favorites so that I can try them out! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003587.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Well, I went and did it. I got a 15&#8221; <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MacBook Pro</a> to replace my Dell. The new Mac was supposed to come in more of the April/May timeframe, but then the Dell had a little explosion &#8212; a flash of light, an overpowering smell of ozone, and then it wouldn&#8217;t turn on for two days (remarkably, after a weekend turned off, the Dell worked fine). That put a crimp in my plans for productivity and whatnot, and I couldn&#8217;t quite trust a sparky laptop, so MacBook Pro time it was. And it&#8217;s wonderful. It&#8217;s beautiful. It feels great, and I love it. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003583.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
