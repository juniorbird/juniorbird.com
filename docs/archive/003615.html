				<p>I really do like the tradition of New Year&#8217;s resolutions. Heck, I like it enough I&#8217;ve done it <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000353.html">four</a> <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001004.html">years</a> <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002166.html">in a row</a> <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003045.html">now</a> Life presents us with many daily challenges and, let&#8217;s face it, keeps most of us busy. Making resolutions around now can really help get the old head above the trees, to see the forest. I could use that, especially after the last year. So, in the ol&#8217; Juniorbird tradition, here&#8217;s last year&#8217;s resolutions reviewed and some new ones for 2008.</p>

<h3>Last Year&#8217;s Resolutions Reviewed</h3>


<ol>
<li>Find a networking group to go to, like I used to go to Ryze events<br /><em>Say hello to the Trojan <span class="caps">CEO</span> Network!</em></li>
<li>Join a local Toastmasters club<br /><em>Bet this one appears on my &#8216;08 resolutions!</em></li>
<li>Keep up with people I met in school<br /><em>Did pretty well, actually, for &#8216;ol introverted me</em></li>
<li>Join a martial arts studio, probably either Jiu Jitsu, Aikido, or Krav Maga<br /><em>I also must resolve to blog about Krav Maga, which I&#8217;ve been attending for 3 months, more in &#8216;08</em></li>
<li>Say &#8220;no&#8221; more often<br /><em>Boy, I did bad at this one</em></li>
<li>Keep my plants alive<br /><em>Good news: they&#8217;re all here, even the one the pit bull tried to eat!</em></li>
<li>Get into a habit of regularly reading and outlining business books.<br /><em>Honestly, there&#8217;s such a thing as too much business. Didn&#8217;t do it, didn&#8217;t regret it.</em></li>
<li>Start keeping my finances in some kind of program again &#8212; I ditched Quicken two and a half years ago, as it was corrupting my accounts all the time, but I think it&#8217;s time to start keeping records again.<br /><em>Switched to <a href="http://moneydance.com/">Moneydance</a>, which was fine, and used it for a year; now moved to <a href="http://www.iggsoftware.com/ibank/">iBank</a>, which appears to be slicker and more Mac-y (perhaps more on this later). Anyway, kept it all up-to-date, which has been handy budget- and planning-wise.</em></li>
</ol>



<p>So what&#8217;s the tally: 5 out of 8 nailed, 1 abandoned, and 2 busts. Not perfect, but I feel pretty proud.</p>

<h3>This Year&#8217;s Resolutions</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s going to be a big year, but I think I can wedge a little self-improvement in.</p>


<ol>
<li>Join Toastmasters</li>
<li>Stick with Krav, and, especially, use it to improve my conditioning</li>
<li>Post twice weekly to <a href="http://wadearmstrong.com">WadeArmstrong.com</a> &#8212; one 4-600 words, one links</li>
<li>Post twice weekly here. I&#8217;ve got an exciting publishing calendar for Juniorbird.com, including a recipe of the month; drink of the month; photo that you can put on your desktop (I like to switch mine up), and even an attempt at ongoing fiction (I promise low quality!)</li>
<li>Kick up the &#8216;ol wardrobe a notch, by being a bit more daring</li>
<li>Assert myself more in restaurants &#8212; I don&#8217;t always ask what&#8217;s in a dish when I order it, and sometimes, what with my food allergies, that reaches up and bites me</li>
<li>Set up a regular get-together with school friends</li>
<li>Appreciate the <span class="caps">AIG </span>as much as she deserves</li>
</ol>



<p>See you in a year to check in on my progress!</p>

                    <p>I commend you for already doing a great job on numbers five, six, and especially eight! And how about I resolve to help you with numbers two (as long as you can take my elbows), four (trying your drinks and encouraging fiction), and seven (I could stand to brush up on the old party-hosting skills)? </p>
