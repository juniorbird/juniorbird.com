				<p>Every weekend I work up a full menu for the coming week; I like to have a dinner and a lunch to cook, as well as the normal sandwich, cereal, etc. Having the two cooked meals ensures that I eat two filling, nutritious and healthy meals every day, as well as breakfast, snacks and other meals. This way I have plenty of energy to go to the gym and work hard on various client Web sites.</p>

<p>By preparing this food myself, I know what goes into what I&#8217;m eating and know if it&#8217;s more (or less!) healthy than McDonalds. By preparing all of the food ahead of time, I ensure that, every time I get hungry, there&#8217;s something healthy to eat in the fridge. This alone has cut down on my fast food runs.</p>

<p>This week, I decided to cook Indian. For dinner, I made a dry cubed pork dish:<br />

<p>For lunch, I made a chicken and peas dish that can be served with rice:<br />
<img src="/images/compulsivefood/chicken.jpg" alt="a bowl of chicken and rice" /></p>

<p>Both very tasty! From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0811811832/">Madhur Jaffrey&#8217;s Quick And Easy Indian Cooking</a> , a highly recommended Indian cookbook filled with recipes that are easy to make and use ingredients you can really find.</p>

<p>But then I went too far. See, I&#8217;m planning to eat these dishes slowly over the course of the week, right? So, why not split everything up into nice individual portions?<br />
<img src="/images/compulsivefood/containers.jpg" alt="three plastic containers" />
Yep, that&#8217;s one day&#8217;s food &#8212; a container of chicken, a container of pork and a container of boiled potatoes. All perfect and ready to be reheated. Maybe a little too perfect.</p>

<p>Yes, I think I&#8217;m too prepared this time. And you know what? It&#8217;s going to continue, too. Every week, perfectly-sized portions for each day. Just you watch.</p>
