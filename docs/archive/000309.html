				<p>The folks over at Optimization Week have <a href="http://www.optimizationweek.com/reviews/president/">analyzed the Web sites of the major Presidential candidates</a> and have found these sites to be, overall, slow and inaccessible to those with disabilities (or those who choose to use the keyboard, and not mice, to navigate; or those who choose not to load images; and so forth). Fast-loading and accessible sites aren&#8217;t unattainable goals, they&#8217;re best practices. Why is it that the candidates to lead our country are behind the curve on Web design? And, no, &#8220;it&#8217;s not important&#8221; isn&#8217;t the answer I&#8217;m looking for.</p>
				
				<p>The only candidate with a reasonably-sized first page is <a href="http://www.carolforpresident.com/">Carol Moseley Braun</a>. All of the other candidates&#8217; first pages weigh in at over 100K, with good old <a href="http://www.dickgephardt2004.com/">Dick Gephardt&#8217;s</a> page nearly a breathtaking 700K in size &#8212; that&#8217;s about ten times the fairly standard guideline of 70K for a first page. I can&#8217;t see anything so special about Dick&#8217;s site, but the size does appear to be bloated by code filled with Internet Explorer-specific attributes and badly-compressed images. Sixty-four of <a href="http://www.johnkerry.com/">John Kerry&#8217;s</a> 216K come from a Flash animation &#8212; not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with Flash, but it should only be used when it communicates things that static <span class="caps">HTML </span>can&#8217;t, which this animation doesn&#8217;t do at all. Of course, that&#8217;s better than <a href="http://kucinich.us">Dennis Kucinich&#8217;s site</a>, which doesn&#8217;t even load at all at this time.</p>

<p>A simple approach using <a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/000292.html"><span class="caps">CSS </span>and semantic markup</a> could have given the candidates pages that looked just as good, were easier to maintain and update, and were compatible with all common Web browsers. Instead, convoluted old-style table layouts with formatting instructions given redundantly for each element, rather than separated out into a single style sheet, make for large, slow-loading and difficult-to-maintain sites.</p>

<p>The most glaring accessibility issue on the vast majority of sites is the omission of alt text on images. Alt text is read to non-sighted users and is often used by sighted users who choose not to load images. It&#8217;s also used by search engines to determine the relevance of pages to queries. There&#8217;s no excuse to omit alt text &#8212; it&#8217;s comparatively easy to include for 90% of images, and most sites will do anything to get better search engine results!</p>

<p>All these candidates&#8217; sites fall short of current best practices; in 2000, this was unsurprising, but, four years later, it&#8217;s embarrassing. Especially with Dean&#8217;s Internet-driven campaign, I would have expected better results. But best practices are hard things to follow, especially when they&#8217;re for things, like code, that aren&#8217;t obvious to the end-user. </p>
