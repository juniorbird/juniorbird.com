				<p>Christmas brought a lot of things, not least of which was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307383199?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wadearmstrong-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0307383199" target="_blank">Rachael Ray&#8217;s Big Orange Book Cookbook.</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wadearmstrong-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0307383199" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"/> Now, I&#8217;m admittedly a big Rachael Ray fan, not so much for her cooking or her show as for her looks. But this was the first time I actually cooked anything from her. With no puns in mind, I picked a delicious-looking meatball recipe.</p><!-- more --><p>First I should probably say something about the Rachael Ray crush. If you&#8217;ve met my wife, you could probably guess that an aggressive, brash New Yorker with curvy hips would be just my twice. This came out early in our relationship: it only took a few weeks for me to fake up this photo for DJ L&#8217;il Bit:<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/28482702@N00/4400816928" title="View 'Courtney or Rachael?' on Flickr.com" target="_blank"><img border="0" width="432" alt="Courtney or Rachael?" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2701/4400816928_ef91acdd3a.jpg" height="219"/></a></p><p>I&#8217;ll admit to being happy that I picked a redhead.</p><p>Anyway, back to the meal. It was quick, as advertised, although I complicated it up by making a side dish of mashed rutabagas. That&#8217;s right, rutabagas. If you caught the last cooking-related entry, you&#8217;ll know that rutabagas have become the low-carb household replacement for potatoes. They&#8217;re big winners, just boil them a smidge and the bitterness goes away. Tonight, we boiled them with salt and garlic, and then mashed them with rosemary, olive oil, and salt and pepper:<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/28482702@N00/4400800524" title="View 'Rachael Ray's Meatballs' on Flickr.com" target="_blank"><img border="0" width="500" alt="Rachael Ray's Meatballs" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2777/4400800524_fac610893e.jpg" height="333"/></a></p><p>A great mashed potato substitute with half the carbs and twice the fiber. But the real point was the main course, the meatballs. I doubled the recipe, to make leftovers last all week long, and roasted them in the oven:<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/28482702@N00/4400798472" title="View 'Rachael Ray's Meatballs' on Flickr.com" target="_blank"><img border="0" width="500" alt="Rachael Ray's Meatballs" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4071/4400798472_f9c9e2ee35.jpg" height="333"/></a></p><p>Meanwhile, I made Rachael&#8217;s fire-roasted tomato sauce with balsamic, adding in a bay leaf and some rosemary, mostly because the rosemary came from the backyard. Fire-roasted tomatoes in a can are incredible things, and, when you pair them with some delicately-sweated red onions, well, it&#8217;s just win all around<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/28482702@N00/4400034063" title="View 'Rachael Ray's Meatballs' on Flickr.com" target="_blank"><img border="0" width="333" alt="Rachael Ray's Meatballs" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4033/4400034063_f861fbe06d.jpg" height="500"/></a></p><p>We threw a few frozen asparagus spears on the grill pan with some salt, pepper, and crushed garlic, just real quickly as a side dish:<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/28482702@N00/4400035541" title="View 'Rachael Ray's Meatballs' on Flickr.com" target="_blank"><img border="0" width="500" alt="Rachael Ray's Meatballs" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2755/4400035541_24c7005939.jpg" height="333"/></a></p><p>Everything came together even better than I made it sound here:<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/28482702@N00/4400801954" title="View 'Rachael Ray's Meatballs' on Flickr.com" target="_blank"><img border="0" width="500" alt="Rachael Ray's Meatballs" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2761/4400801954_bcfd873dc0.jpg" height="333"/></a></p><p>It tasted even better than my non-existent food styling skills makes it look! With nothing but olive oil and lean beef, this dish is a cheap, healthy winner that we&#8217;re sure to make again.</p>
