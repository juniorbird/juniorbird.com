							<h3>Customer Service is Scary</h3>
							<p class="date">Aug 31, 2007 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_elsewhere.html">Elsewhere</a></p>
							
							<p>Giving good customer service is tough. It&#8217;s easy to get 90% of it right and still leave the customer with a bad taste in their mouth &#8212; an unpleasant truth when your business model depends on delighting the customer, as does mine. I was reminded of the delicacy of customer service last weekend, when a major airline lost my bags.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/business/customer_service_is_scary.php">Read on&#8230;</a>
						
									
				
					
				
							<h3>Why Isn't There a Place to Find Out About LAPD Chases in Real Time?</h3>
							<p class="date">Aug 29, 2007 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_will_somebody_please_explain_to_me.html">Will Somebody Please Explain To Me...</a></p>
						    	
							<p><span class="caps">OK, </span>let me lead this one off by clarifying. I often joke that I live in the ghetto; at the same time, I&#8217;ve never felt unsafe in my neighborhood. Everyone&#8217;s nice. That said, there&#8217;s either a high-speed chase going right by here or an <span class="caps">LAPD </span>chopper hovering over here once a month. And what do I ever hear about it? It&#8217;s not in the LA Times (they only have <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/homicidereport/">a blog to cover murders</a>, and even that&#8217;s a day behind), it&#8217;s not on <a href="http://cbs2.com/"><span class="caps">KCAL</span> 9</a>. But, gosh, it seems to be important enough at the moment, given the number of sirens I hear and what I imagine is the cost of keeping a chopper in the air. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003443.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>For The Birds</h3>

							<p>I suppose it&#8217;s no secret that I haven&#8217;t followed the Orioles closely in years. And it&#8217;s no secret why &#8212; they don&#8217;t make it to Anaheim often, and Chavez Ravine even less; they&#8217;re almost never on TV over here; and, of course too many losses, too little in the way of positive changes. But the O&#8217;s<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003421.html#fn1">1</a></sup> are my team, and I love them. I love them even though they lost their last game 30-3, becoming the first team to give up 30 runs in 110 years. Actually, I think I love them even more now.<br />

							<p>If I were wheezing and gasping for breath as I begged for an appointment with my doctor&#8217;s receptionist, would you want me to keep it down during said begging? <span class="caps">OK, </span>you&#8217;d probably want to hear all the drama of my life since you were stuck waiting for your appointment. Being a gossip hound, I know that was exactly how I felt. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003417.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
							
							<h3>Amazon Got Me Trouble (But My Business Plan Saved Me)</h3>
							<p class="date">Aug 15, 2007 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_elsewhere.html">Elsewhere</a></p>
							
							<p>Everyone expects free shipping, thanks to Amazon. Including my company&#8217;s customers. I can&#8217;t blame them; heck, I expect free shipping myself. But it&#8217;s tough when you&#8217;re sending 30lb boxes of perishable goods around the country. Shipping costs can be equal to product costs for some East Coast destinations &#8212; and this cuts down on my sales. It&#8217;s tough, but there is a silver lining. Once again, simply having a business plan has saved me. Well, that and making some phone calls.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/entrepreneurship/amazon_got_me_trouble_but_my_business_plan_saved_me.php

							<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying there&#8217;s anything wrong with a gin and tonic on a hot day&#8212; nothing a Campari and soda can&#8217;t fix, anyway &#8212; but sometimes you want something with a little more pizazz, and the champagne drinks are just too hoity-toity.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003410.html#fn1">1</a></sup> Here&#8217;s my proposal for a nice brunch or post-brunch sippin&#8217; martini.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003410.html#fn2">2</a></sup> <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003410.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Good Morning!</h3>

							<p>Let the official record show, today Junior said a new word. He said it clearly, loudly, and proudly, and I do think I&#8217;ll hear it again! I got out of bed, uncovered his cage, walked out of my bedroom and was called back with a boisterous &#8220;good morning!&#8221; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003406.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>For some reason, very few things make a home look bad to me as a fridge whose light has burnt out. To me, it says &#8220;I just don&#8217;t care about having a pleasant, maintained place to live.&#8221; I mean, you go into the fridge several times every day, right? So it&#8217;s not like you can avoid noticing it.</p>

<p>Of course, with an attitude like that, my fridge light would burn out. For the last week, I&#8217;ve had a nice, ghetto kitchen with a darkened fridge. Tr&egrave;s Palms. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003401.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
							
							<h3>Productivity in a Moment</h3>
							<p class="date">Aug  8, 2007 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_elsewhere.html">Elsewhere</a></p>
							
							<p>I always fall down on my planned approaches to productivity when, at that moment, it&#8217;s not productive to be productive. I&#8217;m sure you know those times &#8212; I should do something, it&#8217;s actually kind of important, but it&#8217;s either inconvenient or impossible and so I don&#8217;t do it right then. And then the moment passes and the thought is lost or the task becomes even harder to do. For a while, recording my mileage, keeping up on my credit card purchases, and even capturing ideas on-the-go were all in this category. But, lately, I&#8217;ve been doing a lot better &#8212; because I made the effort to set myself up to be productive in a moment, any moment.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/productivity/productivity_in_a_moment.php">Read on&#8230;</a>
						
									
				
					
							
							<h3>Back in the Saddle</h3>
							<p class="date">Aug  1, 2007 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_elsewhere.html">Elsewhere</a></p>
							
							<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of Getting Things Done; but I haven&#8217;t been very <span class="caps"><span class="caps">GTD</span></span>-y lately. With too much on my plate, I fell off the wagon. But the point of <span class="caps"><span class="caps">GTD </span></span>is to make it easier to handle the volume of work coming in, right? So why did a more busy, more overwhelming time get me away from <span class="caps"><span class="caps">GTD</span></span>?</p>

<p>The answer isn&#8217;t in the failure of the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">GTD </span></span>approach &#8212; it&#8217;s in the failure of my implementation. And this answer pointed me to the value of maintaining a strong personal commitment to the work you do &#8212; and continually questioning that commitment when you don&#8217;t get that work done.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/productivity/back_in_the_saddle.php">Read on&#8230;</a>
