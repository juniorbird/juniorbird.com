							<h3>More Cruise? Yes Please!</h3>
							<p class="date">Feb 28, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_photos.html">Photos</a>, <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_travel.html">Travel</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Sorry I&#8217;ve been so bad at posting lately &#8212; between a new job and a new project (watch for it to launch in a few weeks to a couple of months!) I haven&#8217;t had the time I should to get on the ol&#8217; Juniorbird.com. Which is also my way of saying that I may not post so much for the next few months either. Of course, the corrollary is that, the more you do, the more you do, so you may see more from me here.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003808.html#fn1">1</a></sup> But I do have something for you, something special from the cruise.  <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003808.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Whipping Gretzky</h3>
							<p class="date">Feb 24, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_dreams.html">Dreams</a></p>
						    	
							<p>We were playing a three-way game of hockey &#8212; us, the Finnish national team, and the Swedish national team, that is. With only two ends to the ice, we&#8217;d switch one team out when enough goals were scored against them. Except those darned Swedes never seemed to get scored on &#8212; they had their strategy down, and Wayne Gretzky in goal. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003805.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>If They Could See Me Now</h3>

							<p>I like vacations. I&#8217;d actually kind of forgotten about that, but I like them. So I&#8217;ve tried to <a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel">take more lately</a>. Cruises had popped up on our radar a few months ago; prices have been dropping dramatically as cruise lines have desperately tried to keep bookings up. Looking around for things to do for Valentine&#8217;s Day, a 4-night Carnival cruise to Catalina and Ensenada was actually so cheap as to be competitive with a nice dinner out. So I bought my honey one. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003802.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>These Krav Students Walk Into a MMA Fight...</h3>
							<p class="date">Feb  8, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_spurts.html">Spurts</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Call me bloodthirsty. Some years ago &#8212; back in junior high and high school &#8212; I took Tae Kwon Do, and sparred regularly. It was a way of driving off the introvert shyness, and learning action and control. When I started taking <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=krav+maga">Krav Maga</a>; and, for that matter, when I see the <span class="caps">UFC </span>or something on TV &#8212; that makes me miss fighting. When the <a href="http://kravmaga.com/">Krav studio I go to</a> announced that, henceforth, graduates of the Fight class would fight in front of an audience, well, I sure wanted to be part of that audience, as did the <span class="caps">AIG.</span> So, towards Santa Monica with us! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003798.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
							
							<h3>Stimulus for Startups</h3>
							<p class="date">Feb  5, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_elsewhere.html">Elsewhere</a></p>
							
							<p>Washington&#8217;s all a-flutter over what the stimulus package to help us get out of this economic slump. Is it tax cuts? Infrastructure projects? Bank bailouts? Startups are a unique breed, and need unique tools to drive growth. Specifically, they need cash. Up front.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/entrepreneurship/stimulus_for_startups.php">Read on&#8230;</a>
