				<p>Today, I went to the supermarket &#8212; by which I mean Payless Produce, Halal Carneceria, and 89&cent; store &#8212; earlier than usual, and ended up waiting in line quite some time next to a woman who claimed to be the mother of <span class="caps">WWE </span>star &#8220;Chris &#8220;The Master&#8221; Masters&#8221;:http://www.wwe.com/superstars/raw/chrismasters/. She was dressed for the place, in a dingy off-the-shoulder, hot-in-1992 print sundress, to go with her probably hot-in-1988 boobs, which were rarin&#8217; to pop out of that thing. With big, cheap, dark plastic sunglasses &#8212; likely to hide her pinpointed, tweaker pupils &#8212; overtanned skin, overeprocessed, brittle-looking long brown hair, and sexy-in-1990 pink lipstick, she leaned in too close to tell me the following, which I swear is all verbatim:</p>

<p><strong><span class="caps">HER</span>:</strong> &#8220;Oh my God,&#8221; (nearly stepping on underfoot small Latin child), &#8220;Well she&#8217;s sure got them,&#8221; (referring presumably to the mother of said small Latin child, who also had a younger child with her), &#8220;and I&#8217;ve still got mine, I&#8217;m not letting that bitch get him.&#8221;<br />
<strong>ME:</strong> &#8220;That&#8217;s the spirit!&#8221; (Clearly, I didn&#8217;t understand what I was getting myself into.)<br />
<strong><span class="caps">HER</span>:</strong> &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m not letting that bitch get my only son. She&#8217;s like ten years older than him and that bitch thinks she can take him away from me. Well not me! No, I got her on national television. I served her. On basic cable! Ha. That bitch didn&#8217;t know what she was in for when she crossed me. My son&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got and that bitch is never getting him.&#8221;<br />
<strong>ME:</strong> &#8220;Hmm!&#8221; (At this point, I&#8217;d realized that this woman was not, in fact, good conversation for the next three minutes but was, rather, extraordinarily high, plus probably generically delusional to boot.)<br />
<strong><span class="caps">HER</span>:</strong> &#8220;Do you know that bitch is like ten years older than him? And she thinks she&#8217;s so hot. She just lost  a lot of weight and made herself over to look more like this,&#8221; (runs her hands down the side of her body), &#8220;and she&#8217;s still got that big nose. She&#8217;s so not hot.&#8221;<br />
<strong>ME:</strong> &#8220;Huh!&#8221; (At this point, I had her pegged from her face as either about 50 or about 35+the ravages of crank, and was assuming the latter, which left her son about 12-15, and I really didn&#8217;t want to hear about his 25-year-old suitor.)<br />
<strong><span class="caps">HER</span></strong>: &#8220;But you know I got her. I got her on Unforgiven, on <span class="caps">TV, </span>you know Unforgiven? I wrote them letters and put up a Web page and told everyone about her. All her secrets. And they got her! Did you see her on TV? She asked my son &#8212; you know I made him that, I made him what he is today, I tried to make it in Hollywood but this is a tough town, but I knew how my son could make it, I did everything for him, I set him up so that he can succeed, and look at him, he&#8217;s succeeded, he&#8217;s out there now and he&#8217;s on top. I gave him all of that and she&#8217;s never taking him away from me.&#8221;<br />
<strong>ME:</strong> &#8220;Wow you did!&#8221; (Oh dear, I&#8217;m not nearly to the register yet.)<br />
<strong><span class="caps">HER</span></strong>: &#8220;Do you know she thinks he&#8217;s going to marry her? That bitch! She doesn&#8217;t know, he&#8217;s mine and he always will be. All I gave him! I made him who he is! Do you know they call him The Masterpiece? You know I made him that? I came up with that idea and made his body like that. That&#8217;s all because of me. And that bitch thinks she made him. And that bitch thinks that she can ride him &#8216;til she&#8217;s on top,&#8221; (my conversation partner thrusts her hips to make it clear that she&#8217;s using the word &#8220;ride&#8221; in multiple ways), &#8220;but I&#8217;m the one who got him to the top.&#8221;<br />
<strong>ME:</strong> &#8220;Well, good for you.&#8221;<br />
<strong><span class="caps">HER</span>:</strong> &#8220;But I got her, did you see that? On national TV! She thinks she can be all sexy, with her long brown hair and her body,  and she was on <span class="caps">TV, </span>interviewing my son, and she says, &#8216;so Chris, you&#8217;re the Master&#8230; bater?&#8217; you know, &#8216;cause he&#8217;s known as &#8216;The Masterpiece&#8217;, and he gets all mad and says &#8216;No, I&#8217;m the Master<i>piece</i>, like Michaelangelo made,&#8217; and she says &#8216;Oh, like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle?&#8217; Ha! You should&#8217;ve seen her! I told them she was stupid, I wrote them letters, and finally they let her show it! You shoulda seen that! I punked her! She thought she could get all sexy, making her body like mine, and yeah she looks like me but she don&#8217;t got what I got.&#8221;<br />
<strong>ME:</strong> &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to buy my food now&#8230;&#8221;<br />
<strong><span class="caps">HER</span>:</strong> (Goes to the other register, starts unloading her stuff onto the belt, puts it in with the stuff they&#8217;re bagging at the other register, then, says to the guy who&#8217;s bagging his stuff,) &#8220;Oh, sorry, I&#8217;m all on top of your groceries, sorry, didn&#8217;t mean to, that&#8217;s not what I want to be on top of, you know what I&#8217;m saying?&#8221;<br />
<strong>ME:</strong> Buys my stuff and walks out the door.<br />
<strong><span class="caps">HER</span>:</strong> (Running up after me,) &#8220;Hey, you got basic cable? Watch it Monday night, <span class="caps">USA,</span> Channel 40. Laugh at that bitch when she says something stupid! And laugh at my son too! Look at me! Look at where I&#8217;m shopping!&#8221; &#8212; incidentally, where I&#8217;m shopping &#8212; &#8220;After all I&#8217;ve done, you think he could get me a house, set me up, I could shop at a good place, you know? Look at me! Look at this place! I shouldn&#8217;t have that! If you see that girl, say,&#8221; (and this at the top of her lungs, in the parking lot,) &#8220;fuck you you whore, keep the fuck away, you know?&#8221; (Slams car door).</p>

<p>I love the famous. Clearly, &#8220;spurned relatives of C-list celebrities&#8221; would make a wonderful reality show.</p>
