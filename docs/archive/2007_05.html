							<h3>Knowledge Supply Chain Management</h3>
							<p class="date">May 30, 2007 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_elsewhere.html">Elsewhere</a></p>
							
							<p>My father, who writes about issues in education in <a href="http://www.changinghighereducation.com/">his blog</a>, recently suggested that <a href="http://www.changinghighereducation.com/2006/03/what_business_a.html">universities are in the knowledge supply chain management business</a>. That made me ask myself: if there is a knowledge supply chain, then there must somewhere be an inventory of knowledge, right? My father argues that <a href="http://www.changinghighereducation.com/2007/04/who_are_our_cus.html">inventory is held in the universities</a>, which create and collect knowledge, but I&#8217;d say that knowledge inventory is much more held in the hands of university graduates, who store knowledge in case their employers ever need it. This just-in-time inventory system allows businesses to avoid investing in knowledge creation and management, but means that individuals &#8212; the player with the least ability to pay &#8212; are stuck holding the inventory and paying the purchase and holding cost thereof. As college educations become more expensive, we must shift knowledge inventory-holding from individuals and to universities; if universities help us do this, they can make more money doling out that knowledge to in a just-in-time manner than they do pushing that inventory into the personal inventory of hundreds of thousands of grads every year.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/business/knowledge_supply_chain_management.php">Read on&#8230;</a>
						
									
				
					
							
							<h3>AQNT: Bad Buy at Any Price</h3>
							<p class="date">May 21, 2007 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_elsewhere.html">Elsewhere</a></p>
							
							<p>When Google bought DoubleClick, many people predicted a run on the online ad industry. Well, they were right, and they were even on target with aQuantive&#8217;s price. Too bad that, in buying aQuantive, Microsoft overpaid for assets that they can&#8217;t use.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/business/aqnt_bad_buy_at_any_price.php">Read on&#8230;</a>
						
									
				
					
				
							<h3>Radio Free Palms</h3>

							<p>The rest of you are not lucky enough to have personalized radio that plays just for you. That&#8217;s a pity, because good &#8216;ol over-the-air radio is going away, and there&#8217;s nothing like these simple, non-digital broadcasts to make you feel at home. And, by over-the-air, I mean bellowed out by your neighbor at all hours of the day or night.<br />

							<h3>Oh Transgendered Individual at Baja Fresh...</h3>

							<p>I applaud you getting out there and not being shy in the middle of your transformation. And, heck, you&#8217;re looking pretty good! You&#8217;ve got great legs, and, let me say, I really want to give you props for the breasts you&#8217;ve chosen. A lot of guys would&#8217;ve gone big, but you picked some that are rather small and very tasteful on your athletic frame. Very soon, you&#8217;re going to look pretty good for a 50-some-year-old woman.<br />

							<h3>Giving Good Business Card</h3>
							<p class="date">May 14, 2007 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_elsewhere.html">Elsewhere</a></p>
							
							<p>I&#8217;ve been buying business cards for my new employees lately, giving me a lot of time to think about what exactly makes a good business card. Business cards are surprisingly important business tools, but many of the cards that you&#8217;ll see out there today are surprisingly bad at being useful tools. Many boring, traditional cards are actually much better at being business cards than are beautiful, clever, cutting-edge pieces.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/business/giving_good_business_card.php">Read on&#8230;</a>
						
									
				
					
							
							<h3>Introducing Dine to Thrive</h3>
							<p class="date">May  7, 2007 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_elsewhere.html">Elsewhere</a></p>
							
							<p>For the past year, I&#8217;ve been working on starting a company, and I&#8217;m proud to announce that we are finally in business. Really, it&#8217;s just the beginning of an entrepreneurial journey, but it feels like a big change to me. So, here it is: introducing Dine to Thrive.</p><a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/entrepreneurship/introducing_dine_to_thrive.php">Read on&#8230;</a>
						
									
				
					
				
							<h3>Dear Revlon Run/Walk for Breast Cancer</h3>

							<p>Thank you for mangling the two fundraising e-mails that I tried to send out to my contact list. I&#8217;m glad that you ensured that I didn&#8217;t look too polished to the many people who I asked for donations, although I&#8217;ll admit that I&#8217;m not quite sure why. Anyway, I appreciate that <a href="https://www.revlonrunwalk.com/la/secure/MyWebPage.cfm?pID=366860&amp;CFID=645237">raising money for breast cancer research</a> shouldn&#8217;t be too trivial a task. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003278.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
