				<p>&#8220;I have no questions. I have nothing to add.&#8221; That&#8217;s what you want to hear from the <span class="caps">CEO </span>of a major cable TV company after you&#8217;ve presented to him, and that&#8217;s what my <span class="caps">PRIME </span>consulting team got from the president of Brazillian cable leader <span class="caps">NET</span> Servi&ccedil;os. Two days in Brazil, four fun and interesting site visits, some good food, and a funny tour guide &#8212; plus that positive response &#8212; how can you do better?</p>

<p>My <span class="caps">PRIME </span>team researched implementations of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voip">VoIP</a> internationally and recommended some best practices to roll out VoIP over cable broadband in Brazil. Apparently, the <span class="caps">NET CEO </span>had prepared a presentation on VoIP in case he didn&#8217;t like what we came up with &#8212; but he didn&#8217;t give it; instead, he said that he was impressed, and that we&#8217;d come up with pretty much what <span class="caps">NET </span>was thinking about implementing. He even asked us for our presentation to pass around his office. So far, I think this means that Marshall teams are batting 1.000 &#8212; we&#8217;ve impressed all of our consulting projects with solid presentations and solid analysis and conclusions.</p>

<p>The rest of the Brazil part of the trip has been awfully cool too. First of all, there&#8217;s finally free internet with which to blog (for the previous two entries, we know the answer to the question &#8220;how much will Wade pay to blog?&#8221; is &#8220;$10&#8221;). Second, whereas Chile is all about fish and empa&ntilde;adas, Brazi&#8217;s food is pretty much everything, but different and interesting. So I&#8217;m loving the food &#8212; even though it all seems to be either all-you-can-eat or buffets sold by the kilo, and I&#8217;m likely to put on about ten pounds here.</p>

<p>The site visits have been great too. We&#8217;ve seen <span class="caps">ATM </span>and cell phone factories, driven in circles around S&atilde;o Paulo, and been hosted at lunch by the American Chamber of Commerce. And my Portuguese is coming in handy &#8212; I&#8217;ve figured out where to buy water, where the bathroom is, how to get out of a confusing mall, gotten my food without cream sauce, gotten my juice without ice, and more, all with moderately complete sentences.</p>

<p>This stuff is fun.</p>
