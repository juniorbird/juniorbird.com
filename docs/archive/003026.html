<p>My, my, my, my wrapping it be so hard<br />
Makes me say oh my Lord
Christmas be buggin' me
With a gift to wrap under the tree
It'd feel good if my tape stuck down
I fold nice square corners they turn out round
My gifts don't look smooth
Under the tree people say ewww</p>

<p>I told you homeboy, can't wrap this<br />
Yeah, that's how I wrap it and ya know,
Can't wrap this
Look in my eyes, I can't wrap this
Christmas presents look crinkled and wonky, I can't wrap this</p>

<p>New paper and bows<br />
I got em like that now I wrap with those
But it don't come out neat
And six hours later from wrappin' I'm beat
Ribbons nor bows stay on
Use half a roll of tape and still nothin' won't stick on
Like that, like that
Cold screwin' it up so fall on back
This whole thing it's turned to crap
And this is a present I can't wrap</p>

<p>Yo I told you, can't wrap this<br />
Why I'm cryin' here man, can't wrap this
Yo better teach this sucker how to, can't wrap this</p>

<p>Give me a box or gift bag<br />
Can't make 'em look precise that's why I'm sad
Now you know
Why every Christmas my gifts 'neath the tree I'm shy to show
Paper ain't right
Corners don't lie flat so tape 'em up tight
Somehow I could learn
What it's gonna take to quiet my concern
It looks so bad
It will make the gift recipient sad</p>

<p>I'm sad because you know<br />
Can't wrap this
Can't wrap this
Break it down!
Stop! Cryin' time!</p>

<p>Go with the flow it is said<br />
But if I can't wrap gifts I'd rather I were dead
This same story every year
I need a professional wrapper down here
This is it for this winter
Learn from this and I could be a winner
Next smooth fold that junk
Press it down nice it won't look like a chunk</p>

<p>Darn darn darn damn, I can't wrap this<br />
Look man, can't wrap this
My gifts all get trashed yo, 'cause I know I can't, can't wrap this
Face turns red, gifts look bad, I break down
Can't wrap this
Can't wrap this
Can't wrap this
I break down
Stop! Cryin' time!</p>

<p>Every time you see my presents they don't look square<br />
That such shapes are possible you were not aware
Now why would I want to keep doing this
With others wrappin straight, crisp beautiful gifts
I've wrapped near everything from clothes balls to books
It's wonky all crinkly super wrinkly eww crooked my gifts just don't got the looks</p>

<p>Can't wrap this<br />
Can't wrap this
Can't wrap this
Yeah, Can't wrap this
I told you, can't wrap this
Fat thumbs can't wrap this
Get me outta here, I can't wrap this</p>

<p>I&#8217;m assuming there is a tighly choreographed dance number involved here as well?  And you&#8217;re also, of course, sporting some shiny genie pants and a fade?</p>
