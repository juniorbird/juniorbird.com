				<p>I may be predisposed to a bit of <a href="http://www.aetv.com/hoarders/">hoarding</a>. Not that I collect empty yogurt containers or save used tissues; I just often find myself inclined to keep, you know, bowls that people gave me twelve years ago, or maybe I forget to throw away the stub of the movie ticket for <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0242445/">Exit Wounds</a>.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003847.html#fn1">1</a></sup> One time, Mrs. DJ L&#8217;il Bit said this thing that helps me out, whenever I&#8217;m struggling to decide to throw something away or not: &#8220;that decorative peeler is not your mother&#8217;s love.&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m hopeless when it comes to keeping the place nice; I know how annoying it can be to have a house full of clutter, I <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003498.html">lived next to one for years</a>. And I like to color-code everything. And I always put everything back in the place I found it. Exactly in the same place. Every time. So, you know, it&#8217;s pretty orderly around here. But that saying of Mrs. DJ L&#8217;il Bit still comes in handy &#8212; it&#8217;s easy, simple, and oh so correct. &#8220;That shot glass is not your memories of your trip to Southeast Asia.&#8221; &#8220;That t-shirt is not your college experience.&#8221; Etcetera.</p>

<p>But then there are the martini glasses. From Ikea. They <em>are</em> my love. Literally. And I&#8217;m about to sell them in a garage sale. They&#8217;ve been replaced.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="caps">DJ.</span> L&#8217;il Bit and I had been dating for just about two and a half months when we both needed to run to Ikea. There&#8217;s nothing like browsing through Ikea, asking yourself if you need a round cutting board, or a corkboard made for kids, or another duvet cover, or a frosted plastic lamp in this year&#8217;s shape, or a fern. (Since I like to keep stuff, the answer is: no, I don&#8217;t need it.)</p>

<p>Anyway, one thing about Mrs. DJ L&#8217;il Bit: she likes her hard liquor. Not that I can complain, since I&#8217;ve been known to enjoy a scotch,<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003847.html#fn2">2</a></sup> and I&#8217;m very picky about my gin. Put the two of us together, and we drink a lot of martinis. Starting from our very first dates, we&#8217;d really have a couple each every evening we hung out together, at least at her place; at mine, well, see, I didn&#8217;t have martini glasses.</p>

<p>So there I was, at Ikea, standing in front of a big display of martini glasses, trying to decide if I needed to buy them. It wasn&#8217;t the expense so much; it was that I have plenty of stuff, and if the martini glasses were going to come into the house, well, then something might have to leave. Thus I&#8217;d better really want those martini glasses. Would I keep the current girlfriend, DJ L&#8217;il Bit, for long enough to justify getting the new glasses? Or would we move on, and I find myself drinking more wine, or even soda, with the next girl? </p>

<p>That&#8217;s when the future Mrs. DJ L&#8217;il Bit appeared by my side, having finished looking at the kitchen goodies that she needed &#8212; probably silicone spatulas and plates with elephants on them. The future Mrs. DJ L&#8217;il Bit, she said to me: &#8220;so, deciding if you&#8217;ll keep me long enough to buy those glasses?&#8221;</p>

<p>She always did get right to the point.</p>

<p>And I did buy the martini glasses. Not because she called me on it; because I&#8217;d already decided that, yes, I would probably keep her long enough to justify having them in my home. Because, you know, I was completely falling for her.</p>

<p>You see, then, that the martini glasses &#8212; they <strong>were</strong> my love. I bought them because I was ready to make a bet on us. So it&#8217;s funny that, since I bet right, now they&#8217;re headed for the garage sale, replaced by fancy new martini glasses off of our registry. Which I rather suppose are our love too.</p>
