				<p>The <span class="caps">AIG </span>and I are big <a href="http://www.scifi.com/battlestar/">Battlestar Galactica</a> fans. Don&#8217;t laugh; I&#8217;ve been saying for years that it&#8217;s incredibly well-written, and, given that she&#8217;s a professional TV writer, I&#8217;d say there&#8217;s some evidence I&#8217;m right. Anyway, I&#8217;ve been catching her up thanks to my <span class="caps">DVD </span>collection, but Season 3 isn&#8217;t on <span class="caps">DVD </span>and Season 4 starts in just 3 months. Getting all the episodes in is hard work. That&#8217;s where <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b/?&amp;node=16261631">Amazon Unbox</a> comes in.</p>

<p>I have a few of the season-ending episodes on my Tivo, and the <span class="caps">AIG </span>was on-the-ball enough to Tivo a lot of other episodes from a marathon that SciFi was having. But we missed a few others, and what good is a partial season of a show with ongoing plotlines? </p>

<p>Since Unbox can download to Tivo, we decided to try that out.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003631.html#fn1">1</a></sup> Initial setup was trivial for my Tivo Series 2, but Amazon incorrectly told us that the <span class="caps">AIG&#8217;</span>s Tivo Series 2 was incompatible. Turns out that she had never set it up on the Tivo Web site to Allow Transfers and Video Downloads. (If only the error message had pointed this out! I had to deduce this cause on my own.) Once I checked those two boxes, completing setup was simple. </p>

<p>Unbox movies can only be bought with One-Click, which is reasonable given that there&#8217;s no physical item to be delivered and the price is so low (just $2 for the <span class="caps">BSG </span>episode). Download of one episode took about 25 minutes, but another took several hours. It&#8217;s not obvious why this time difference existed. I also had to initiate a connection to the Tivo servers to start the download; I guess there&#8217;s no way to push a download to a Tivo, since the box is used to getting its instructions by dialing in. Unbox is no replacement for true Video on Demand, at least yet.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003631.html#fn2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The episodes were clear and ad-free. While they auto-set to delete 24 hours after being watched, I was able to manually reset the delete date and kept one episode for a week before deciding to delete it to free up space. Save to <span class="caps">VCR </span>did not appear to be disabled, which makes it easy to keep the episode (this is only fair since I bought it, if you ask me).</p>

<p>Would I buy more TV from Unbox? In a second. The <span class="caps">AIG </span>&#8212; not, by any stretch of the imagination, a geeky woman &#8212; actually suggested canceling her Netflix subscription, stating that we rarely watched movies<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003631.html#fn3">3</a></sup> and &#8220;we could get something off Unbox if we really wanted to see it.&#8221; The download wait is at worst shorter than the turnaround for a new movie from Netflix, and I don&#8217;t know anybody who still goes into a (non-specialty) movie rental place anymore.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m an Unbox convert. Setup out of the way, it&#8217;s user-friendly. I might try putting <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003601.html">It&#8217;s a Wonderful Life</a> on my laptop next Christmas to make sure I catch it!</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Surprisingly enough, Battlestar is not on iTunes &#8212; just the kind of geeky tool that the show&#8217;s demo would probably use. Anyway, Unbox downloads to the Tivo, which is already hooked up to the <span class="caps">TV, </span>rather than my laptop, which I&#8217;d have to figure out how to do. Score one for Amazon and Tivo (and here&#8217;s one good guess why Apple wants us to buy the Apple TV).</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> Although I wouldn&#8217;t put it past Time Warner to somehow sniff out Unbox packets and slow them down.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn3"><sup>3</sup> True</p>

                    <p>The only reassurance I can give is that the low rate of movie-watching should be matched, this year, by a higher rate of content posting here. (Not higher quality; you should have learned not to wait for that by now.)</p>
