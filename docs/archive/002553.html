				<p>Yesterday was my official last day of class at Marshall. Barring an incredible reversal of fortune on the two papers and one final left, I&#8217;ll officially have my <span class="caps">MBA </span>in just two weeks! It&#8217;s an exciting thought, and I&#8217;m thrilled about what is in my future. But, ya know what, I&#8217;m kinda sad too.</p>

<p>When I was in junior high, I went to summer camp at this program called <a href="http://www.jhu.edu/cty/"><span class="caps">CTY</span></a>. <span class="caps">CTY </span>was, basically, nerd camp &#8212; a place where us inappropriately smart kids could gather for a few weeks every summer, take classes (during summer!), hang out with people who had the same social proclivities as ourselves, and generally have a grand old time. There was too much Ultimate Frisbee, too much pizza (way too much), co-ed sports, endless Risk games, and even the famous (and feared) Meat Market. It was weeks of heaven. And then I&#8217;d go home and I&#8217;d sleep for  20 hours straight, because who would do anything but stay up &#8216;til all hours in an environment like that. And I&#8217;d cry, too, because I wouldn&#8217;t be this happy again for another year.</p>

<p>Now, this is not one of those blogs that&#8217;s about how much I cried when I was a teenager, and I&#8217;m not claiming that I&#8217;m sitting here crying right now, either (again, not that kind of a blog), but it feels like those old days today. I&#8217;ve spent the last two years around people who are excessively smart, discussing incredible ideas, feeding my brain at every minute, and having fun besides. Sure, it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m going to go back to burly lacrosse players who didn&#8217;t think much of me or teachers who think I&#8217;m too stupid to grok calculus, but I do predict a good dose of culture shock. </p>

<p>Plus, what the hell will I do with all this new free time? I&#8217;ll miss the routine, I&#8217;ll miss the firehose of information, I&#8217;ll miss the highly-targeted 15-minute deep discussions that were all we could spare between work, I&#8217;ll miss free beer on Thursdays, I&#8217;ll miss rock-paper-scissors tournaments, dammit, I&#8217;m ready to go back already.</p>

<p>Think I might be the one to renew? Maybe I&#8217;m lucky there&#8217;s no Carousel; I am about to turn 31.</p>
