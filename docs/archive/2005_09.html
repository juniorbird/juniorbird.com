							<h3>Fire In The Sky</h3>
							<p class="date">Sep 30, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_photos.html">Photos</a></p>
						    	
							<p>My exhausted bones quailing at the thought of cutting a frozen chicken into parts or strugging with my deteriorated old stove, I walked down the street to the <a href="http://overlandcafe.com/">Overland Cafe</a> to get a turkeyburger and garlic fries. Then, turning the corner, the sky rose from behind the apartment building next door and the light of the world changed. The long blue of the evening suddenly became bright red and orange from the cloud rising above <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-093005fires_lat,0,4509311.story?coll=la-home-headlines">the fires</a>. I could almost cry, thinking of the empty camera at my home. I walked a block in dejection, but with my face turned up to look hopelessly at the wonderful sky. Finally the scene overcame me and my desperation drove me to take low-res photos with my cameraphone. Better to get something than nothing. So, not nothing below. Actually, quite a bit more than not nothing: <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001898.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Working Hard or Hardly Working?</h3>
							<p class="date">Sep 28, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_b-school.html">B-School</a>, <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_photos.html">Photos</a></p>
						    	
							<p>So this morning I wrote a 10-page paper. This is either a sign that I&#8217;m working really hard or that I&#8217;m a total slacker who puts big projects off &#8216;til the last minute. Since I&#8217;m finding time to blog right now, one might be inclined to pick the latter.</p>

<p>Anyway, this brings up the big question of the second year, which is: &#8220;do I work hard and learn a shitload and get out in the world ready to take on any challenge, or do I take the easiest classes I can find and try to get out of here with as much of my sanity intact as possible, given that I get the same three letters after my name either way and Marshall doesn&#8217;t report <span class="caps">GPA</span>s to potential employers?&#8221; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001894.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Hair Care Product Whore</h3>
							<p class="date">Sep 23, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_otherwise_uncategorized.html">Otherwise Uncategorized</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Anybody who&#8217;s ever watched me primp for a date knows that I&#8217;m a total primadonna when it comes to hair care products. I like the good stuff, and I&#8217;ll spend on it (something which various of my hairstylists have loved, I&#8217;m sure). Usually, I go for some relatively cutting-edge product, then move on to the next cutting-edge product when the first one becomes hard to find anywhere outside of Sally Beauty Supply. But now it&#8217;s different. Now I look fabulous and I do it with product I got at Target &#8212; and at Target prices. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001881.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>This weekend, I&#8217;ll be hobbling through a one-mile fun run to help raise money for Special Olympics. I know everyone has given a lot lately, for the victims of Katrina&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001868.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>So it&#8217;s a new TV season, but my TiVo &#8220;Now Playing&#8221; list looks the same as ever. Nanny 911 is fun when you&#8217;re watching it with your sweetie, but, now&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001863.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>So, Arizona may have been <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001661.php">hot</a> and <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001587.php">generally mediocre</a>, but it was, from time to time, pretty.

							<h3>A Bad Day For A Bird</h3>

							<p>Hello! How are you? I&#8217;m a pretty bird! Whatcha doin&#8217;? Today I got groomed! I wasn&#8217;t planning on it &#8212; I was going to sit on my boing and arrange my feathers precisely, put my plastic toys in my water (so they soften up and I can destroy them), then drag my wooden toys along the bottom of my cage to make that loud noise. Fun, huh? <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001844.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Not Even Remotely Smurfy (But Very Snowy)</h3>

							<p>It was a wonderful summer. One of the many perks of being the child of two university professors was a month-long family vacation, every summer, and this one was in France. Now, France is a good thing for a seven-year-old, to the extent that a seven-year-old notices France, but what really stood out was the ice cream. Sure, it was all better than American ice cream, but my favorite was Smurf flavor (in French, &#8220;Schtroumpf&#8221;).  <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001836.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I understand that, with today&#8217;s cellular telephone technology, you can contact me at any time. However, that does not mean that you need to contact me at any time; and that does not mean that, if you need to contact me, you should call me. Said cellular telephone technology offers you various methods by which you can effectively, promptly, and appropriately contact me. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001818.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<h3>Fun In The Boys' Locker Room, Featuring Matt and Alex</h3>

							<p>I&#8217;ve always been bad with combination locks. This time last year, when everyone else was celebrating the fact that they had a brand new locker and no longer needed to lug around their 900-page Accounting and 700-page Microecon books at the same time, I could only think &#8220;oh my god, 250 new people &#8212; all of whom I&#8217;d like to impress &#8212; will now have the opportunity to watch me try to open a combination lock multiple times a day.&#8221; And the math is bad: an average of four tries per open, times the three times I go into the locker a day, equals nine unsuccessful attempts to open my locker every day (plus three successful). But then I thought, hey, it&#8217;s not likely to be as bad as third grade. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001811.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Fells Point is one of the oldest, most beautiful, and most fun parts of <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/001649.php">Baltimore</a>, so of course I had to take pictures when I was there.

							<p>It&#8217;s always difficult when two important, beloved parts of one&#8217;s life conflict. Well, that time has finally come for me. While watching Cold Case, I realized: I should&#8217;t let myself fast forward through TV ads anymore. It&#8217;s not just fun anymore; now it&#8217;s education. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001804.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
