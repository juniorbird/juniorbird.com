				<p>At first, I thought that the all-hours late-&#8217;70s arena rock and hair metal was, well, eccentric but amusing. I mean, who really ever gets enough Boston? And a little Styx, now and then, is okay.</p>

<p>It did go a little over the top on weekends, however, when you&#8217;d crank up the Led Zeppelin. Now, I appreciate Zepp&#8217;s blues-charged rock as much as many other people out there (although I do prefer the rock-tinged blues of, say, an Albert Collins or Stevie Ray Vaughan), but the volume at which you chose to listen to Messrs. Plant and Page was, perhaps, a bit excessive.</p>

<p>So, you&#8217;ll understand if I wasn&#8217;t too put out when you moderated your musical indulgences. However, your choice to replace music with <span class="caps">AOL</span> Instant Messenger was a surprise &#8212; not least because you apparently hooked your computer up to the very same speakers you used for Zepp. Believe me when I say that, thanks to what you shared with me, I&#8217;ve learned that you haven&#8217;t really appreciated <span class="caps">AIM </span>unless you&#8217;ve heard the &#8220;new message&#8221; sound that it makes pumped out of speakers that go up to eleven. For every single message. Of a 30-minute conversation.</p>

<p>I just wanted to tell you how very, very glad I am that you finally gave up <span class="caps">AIM.</span> You&#8217;re right to take back your life from the Internet, and try to find friends <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/irl?method=6"><span class="caps">IRL</span></a>. I just wish you hadn&#8217;t chosen to communicate with those friends over your Nextel push-to-talk phone, with its distinctive, signature &#8220;communication complete&#8221; beep. Although, I am impressed that you must have so many hundreds of free minutes every month to talk so incessantly. I must ask that you either:</p>


<ol>
<li>Get an ordinary cell phone so I don&#8217;t hear those beeps anymore.</li>
<li>Speak up so I can at least hear the juicy bits of your conversation too.</li>
</ol>



<p>Thank you for your attention to this matter.</p>
