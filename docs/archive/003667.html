				<p>Thank you for taking me on a scenic tour of your city today, as I searched for parking for <a href="http://expowest.com">an industry conference at your convention center</a>. I never would&#8217;ve seen the reaches of Katella or Harbor avenues without the direction of the digital signs above the road, telling me where to park, what was full and what was open.</p>

<p>And I have to admit, I&#8217;m impressed with what you do with Angel Stadium when you&#8217;re not using it. I mean, all four of the parking signs said to head straight to get to additional convention center parking at Angel Stadium &#8212; that is, the sign on Harbor, north of Katella, facing southbound traffic; the sign on Harbor, south of Katella, facing northbound traffic; the sign on Katella, east of Harbor, facing westbound traffic; and the sign on Katella, west of Harbor, facing eastbound traffic. I don&#8217;t know how you hid Angel Stadium at the corner of Harbor and Katella, through which I drove 4 or 5 times. Good job on that! Must be some Disney technology or &#8212; dare I say &#8212; magic!</p>

<p>Still, I never found the promised Angel Stadium parking. It might have been better to provide accurate directions to the parking on said overhead digital signs. Or, even, wooden signs on the street. Seeing as I drove around for 40 minutes, just to end up parking in the lot we&#8217;d seen first off anyway.</p>

<p>(Unless, that is, you were paid off by the owners of the 7-11 where we stopped for directions and iced coffee. That would&#8217;ve been quite clever on everyone&#8217;s part.)</p>

<p>Oh, also, that parking lot wasn&#8217;t your finest hour either &#8212; the sign in front of the lot we used said &#8220;Closed &#8212; Lot Full.&#8221; Took about 7 minutes to find a spot, and the two people in front of me found one in the same time too. So, accuracy might be a problem overall. But, I believe in you! You can do it. I have a feeling you&#8217;ll get your signage right about the same time I find Angel Stadium. Which might be in just a bit, since it&#8217;s about time I caught an O&#8217;s game.</p>
