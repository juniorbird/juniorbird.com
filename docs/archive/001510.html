				<p>With fortune on our side, some members of my little group in Rio made friends with some locals, and said locals invited us out for dinner and dancing at a Samba club. And I have discovered why Brazillians are so skinny: Samba!</p>

<p>Honestly, I just wanted to sleep in after staying up too late my last night in S&atilde;o Paulo and then getting up too early for the flight to Rio. But, of course, the party vibes of the city prevented that, so I fell in with my compadres and got the front-seat view of a cab ride to the <a href="http://www.severyna.com.br">Severyna Samba club</a> in the Laranjeiras section of town.</p>

<p>First we started out with some food from the northeast of Brazil, and it was incredible. A friend and I shared two kinds of beef, one shredded, and one dried, then moistened again, both sauteed with onions. On the side were potatoes and manioc. I paired this with the incredible A&ccedil;ai juice, which is smokey and buttery and yet reminiscent of blackberries (and, later, with a kiwi-flavored caipirhina). The enormous plate, for just about $10, filled me and my friend up, although I probably could have eaten such incredible food until I exploded. In a fun local trick, this food, and all the drinks I ordered as I danced the night away, were marked on a paper that I held and that I turned in to the register at the end of the night, paying off all at once (with credit! how convenient).</p>

<p>Then the Samba. I once took, with the Wonderful Girlfriend, a Samba class, and I remembered a little of it, so I got up and started to shake my thing just a little bit. Then I discovered that the guy at the table next to me was a professional Samba dancer from New York, and he gave me some quick lessons. In a few, I was shaking it like I knew what I was doing &#8212; or, at least, I was feeling confident enough to believe I was, despite evidence otherwise.</p>

<p>Four and a half hours later, the musicians finally called it a night. That was four and half hours of sweat, exertion, exercise, and, most of all, fun. I danced with friends, I danced with Brazillians, I danced with the Brazillian friend who took us to the club. The rhythm was addictive and I just couldn&#8217;t help myself &#8212; and that&#8217;s a statement that many who know me would never think I would say. But now I love Samba! I can&#8217;t wait to go dancing again.</p>
