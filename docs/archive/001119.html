				<p>My other site over at <a href="http://cleverbird.com">cleverbird.com</a> has been reasonably busy since the beginning my b-school days. I&#8217;d been adding info about various things &#8212; especially <a href="http://cleverbird.com/wiki/pmwiki.php/JobSearchTips/JobSearchTips">finding a job</a> every so often, and, frankly, I&#8217;d outgrown <a href="http://cleverbird.com/pwyky">what was there</a>. So today, in an exceptionally aggressive effort to avoid doing work, I made some changes.</p>

<p>I changed two things in particular:</p>


<ul>
<li>I switched to a new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">wiki</a> engine, <a href="http://www.pmwiki.org/">PmWiki</a></li>
<li>I <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhyRefactorWikiPages">refactored</a> all of my content</li>
</ul>



<h3>Moving to PmWiki</h3>

<p>I had started out using <a href="http://infomesh.net/pwyky/">pwyky</a> as my engine, principally because it was:</p>


<ul>
<li>Easy to install without command-line access</li>
<li>Written in <a href="http://python.org">Python</a>, which I can at least pretend to know</li>
<li>Because it was written in Python, and missing some key features, I thought I&#8217;d add the features to learn more about Python</li>
</ul>



<p>Six months later, those reasons don&#8217;t make as much sense. The features that weren&#8217;t there by and large still arent, because I haven&#8217;t had time to add them. And I&#8217;m recognizing further that, in the future, I&#8217;ll be programming the Web less, and using clever tools like MT and wikis more. Instead, I needed a wiki that was:</p>


<ul>
<li>Still easy to install without command-line access</li>
<li>Offered some kind of security so everyone couldn&#8217;t just change my pages</li>
<li>Offered robust text formatting</li>
<li>Accepted at least some <span class="caps">HTML </span>in pages</li>
<li>Had a reasonable templating system so that I could make it non-hideous</li>
</ul>



<p>Apart from being easy-to-install and non-hideous by defaulty, pwyky sadly was none of these.</p>

<p>After a search, I found PmWiki. It&#8217;s hideous by default, but it has a clever templating system and every other feature I could want. Initial experience suggests it will be a very satisfactory solution.</p>

<h3>Refactoring</h3>

<p>Pwyky offers no export function; PmWiki offers no import. Someday &#8212; probably around the time I get my next wiki engine &#8212; both of these will be must-have features. For the moment, I had few enough pages that I could just cut-and-paste from one wiki to the other. As I was doing so, I realized that cleverbird.com&#8217;s initial organization didn&#8217;t make that much sense. For example, the home page linked to different pages based on the format, not the content, of those pages &#8212; there was actually a top-level link for &#8220;lists.&#8221; </p>

<p>In the name of being reasonable, I organized the new cleverbird.com around the kinds of information I offered. And I split the pages up to facilitate that kind of organization. Yeah, there was a fair amount of rewriting, but that was fun. Now I&#8217;ve just got to make those pages look non-hideous.</p>
