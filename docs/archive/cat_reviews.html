							<h3>Two and a Half Clooneys</h3>
							<p class="date">Dec  6, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_reviews.html">Reviews</a></p>
						    	
							<p>If you say &#8220;1980s movie character archetype,&#8221; maybe you come up with John Rambo, or Ferris Bueller, or Charlie Sheen in <em>Wall Street</em> &#8212; America kicking ass, America growing up, America getting rich &#8212; but the ultimate character archetype of the &#8217;80s for me is someone with a lot less hair, a lot more coiled rage, a lot more cool. Let&#8217;s face it, the &#8217;80s were all about Louis Gossett Jr.  And the &#8217;90s, for every Brad Pitt or tight-lipped Robert Pattinson, there&#8217;s the standard: all the cool, none of the rage, it&#8217;s George Clooney. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003879.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Smackdown: The Blind Side vs. Precious</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov 24, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_reviews.html">Reviews</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I saw a double feature over the weekend: <em>The Blind Side</em> and <em>Precious</em>. Yes, it was a depressing double feature. Yes, I cried. Actually, I cried a lot more for <em>The Blind Side</em>; <em>Precious</em> just left me exhausted. And, while the whole wanting-to-go-to-bed-at-3:30pm-on-a-Sunday thing was a bit of a downside for the whole plan, I would definitely recommend seeing the two in a row; they just have some kind of an affinity for each other. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003852.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

L8s Ang3les is a show featuring 11 local photographers, especially some from the LA times; the Annenberg Space is a brand-new gallery trying to bring some culture to the antiseptic, wealth-filled skyscraper-land that is Century City. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003814.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I like vacations. I&#8217;d actually kind of forgotten about that, but I like them. So I&#8217;ve tried to <a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel">take more lately</a>. Cruises had popped up on our radar a few months ago; prices have been dropping dramatically as cruise lines have desperately tried to keep bookings up. Looking around for things to do for Valentine&#8217;s Day, a 4-night Carnival cruise to Catalina and Ensenada was actually so cheap as to be competitive with a nice dinner out. So I bought my honey one. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003802.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Quantum of Solace</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov 15, 2008 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_reviews.html">Reviews</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Let&#8217;s face it, the Bond franchise had fallen to a pretty low place before <em>Casino Royale</em> &#8212; it had become a series of nearly-unwatchable flicks that drew an audience only because of the woman in the bikini or the gadgets on the car. So I was more than a little worried that <em>Quantum of Solace</em> would turn back towards the bad old days. Fortunately, it didn&#8217;t; <em>Quantum of Solace</em> is a tight, gritty action flick that highlights Daniel Craig&#8217;s sociopathic take on Bond. Sadly, it also has big action montages that make no sense. Most of all, if you like a good movie, and you live in <span class="caps">LA, </span>it&#8217;s worth going to see <em>Quantum of Solace</em> at the Century City mall just to check out their new parking lot system. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003770.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>The <span class="caps">AIG </span>and I are big Battlestar Galactica fans. Don&#8217;t laugh; I&#8217;ve been saying for years that it&#8217;s incredibly well-written, and, given that she&#8217;s a professional TV writer, I&#8217;d say there&#8217;s some evidence I&#8217;m right. Anyway, I&#8217;ve been catching her up thanks to my <span class="caps">DVD </span>collection, but Season 3 isn&#8217;t on <span class="caps">DVD </span>and Season 4 starts in just 3 months. Getting all the episodes in is hard work. That&#8217;s where <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b/?&amp;node=16261631">Amazon Unbox</a> comes in.<br />

							<p>Well, I went and did it. I got a 15&#8221; <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MacBook Pro</a> to replace my Dell. The new Mac was supposed to come in more of the April/May timeframe, but then the Dell had a little explosion &#8212; a flash of light, an overpowering smell of ozone, and then it wouldn&#8217;t turn on for two days (remarkably, after a weekend turned off, the Dell worked fine). That put a crimp in my plans for productivity and whatnot, and I couldn&#8217;t quite trust a sparky laptop, so MacBook Pro time it was. And it&#8217;s wonderful. It&#8217;s beautiful. It feels great, and I love it. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003583.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Have you watched some of the new shows on TV this season? They&#8217;re very retro, which is an interesting response to the couple of years of confusing shows, after the pattern of Lost and Alias, that dominated schedules for a while.<br />

							<h3>300</h3>
							<p class="date">Mar 17, 2007 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_reviews.html">Reviews</a></p>
						    	
							<p>A lot of words have been spent talking about the quality, or lack thereof, of <em>300</em>, the new movie based on a Frank Miller graphic novel. I&#8217;m probably not going to add to the overall value or quality of all of that here. However, if King Leonidas and his Spartans didn&#8217;t mind dying for nothing, then I can&#8217;t see why I should mind blogging for nothing. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003179.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Letters From Iwo Jima</h3>
							<p class="date">Feb 23, 2007 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_reviews.html">Reviews</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I don&#8217;t see many movies these days. Sure, there are a bunch that look good &#8212; heck, even <em>Ghost Rider</em> has my girlfriend <a href="http://imstars.aufeminin.com/stars/fan/D20050516/1914_884147285_eva_mendes_018_H220502_L.jpg">Eva Mendes</a> in it &#8212; but I never seem to get around to seeing them. Not only are movies too expensive, but they&#8217;re in the the theaters for such a short time, and so many of them are complete crap. Expensive, hard-to-find crap is no good. So, the highest praise for a movie might be that it makes me want to see another, specific movie. On that scale, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0498380/">Letters From Iwo Jima</a> scores quite high &#8212; if <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418689/">Flags of Our Fathers</a>, which I had intentionally skipped seeing before, were still in theaters, I&#8217;d rush over to see it. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003141.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Pan's Labyrinth</h3>

							<p>Last night, I saw <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457430/">Pan&#8217;s Labyrinth</a> with a friend. If you&#8217;ve caught the <a href="http://www.moviecentre.net/upcomingmovies/trailer/movie_id_1369.htm">trailer</a>, you may have gotten the impression that this movie is some sort of a magical story of another world. That is slightly correct, but in a very European, Terry Gilliam kind of way. Much of the story takes place in the real world, is violent (exceedingly, at times), and dark; the fantastical world is revealed only in a few short scenes. They promise &#8220;a journey that will make you believe,&#8221; but half the point is &#8212; can you believe? Is it really true? <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003061.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I love Christmas shopping; I love this time of year. While others complain about the crowds, I float along in a haze of joy from the wondrous seasonal music. Oh, I do want to hear you and your drum, and come with all the other faithful, and hear about that holly jolly soul Frosty. But basic requirements of workplace productivity, showering, etc., all prevented me from spending Thanksgiving-Christmas in malls, listening to the piped-in music, and who can trust K-Earth to not play some Beach Boys in December? So, for years, I&#8217;ve been mostly holiday music-less, apart from singing &#8220;O Tannenbaum&#8221;<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002974.html#fn1">1</a></sup> to myself in July. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002974.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p class="date">Oct 22, 2006 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_reviews.html">Reviews</a></p>
						    	
							<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478049/">The US vs. John Lennon</a> leaves a lot on the table. It could have been a thunderous call to call to action, a strong statement of a way in which we could follow in Lennon&#8217;s footsteps in today&#8217;s eerily similar times, but instead it was just a shrine to an artist. In that way, and in many others, it was truly a film for the political environment in which we live &#8212; intriguing, horrifying, demanding action, and ultimately empty of vigor. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002846.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

My last wallet, reasonably well-liked if not particularly perfect (the money clip thing was a good experiment, but not a success for me) fell apart and was discarded without too much fanfare or too many tears.
