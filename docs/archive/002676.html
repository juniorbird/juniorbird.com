				<p>So in about four hours I will leap out into the unknown and get on one of China Air&#8217;s widebodies, headed for Southeast Asia (via Taiwan, with a seven-hour layover &#8212; yecch). I&#8217;m filled with that mix of excitement and dread that always comes before a big trip, with part of me deeply enthused and the other part wishing for a good night&#8217;s sleep in my comfy bed. Seriously, I&#8217;m incredibly looking forward to this trip &#8212; and glad that I was able to make it an environmentally-sounder &#8220;green&#8221; trip.</p>

<p>I made my trip green by offsetting the carbon emissions of the major modes of travel I expect to take &#8212; air, in particular. Now, it&#8217;s hard for me to be more environmentally-sound in getting to Southeast Asia, because the only way to do that is to sail, which takes rather too long. There&#8217;s really no way I can get out of contributing my 1/300th of a widebody&#8217;s carbon output; but I can offset those emissions, by paying a small sum of money to <a href="http://www.carbonneutral.com/shop/index.asp">a company that makes investments in programs</a> that either remove more carbon from the atmosphere &#8212; for instance, planting trees &#8212; or add less carbon to the atmosphere &#8212; for instance, replacing a polluting coal power plant with a wind farm. The net result is that I&#8217;ve invested in programs that take out as much carbon from the atmosphere as my flight puts in, so the world is just as nice when I get home as it is now.</p>

<p>That is to say, already altogether too hot. I&#8217;m excited to get out of here and enjoy too much sun and too much heat as part of a regularly-scheduled vacation, rather than a Los Angeles Summer. With luck, there will be Internet in the Far East, and you&#8217;ll hear from me regularly. Sa wat dee krap!</p>
