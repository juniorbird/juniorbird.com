							<p>It&#8217;s coming down to crunch time if you&#8217;re celebrating Christmas. Nothing&#8217;s better for last-minute gifts than software &#8212; you can just download it, burn the installer to a <span class="caps">CD, </span>and slip that in the ol&#8217; stocking. You don&#8217;t even need to leave the house and brave the parking garage (unless you need to go to Best Buy to grab some blank CDs, that is!). But the question is: what do you get the geek who has everything? Or, worse, what do you get the ordinary person who doesn&#8217;t care what they run on their computer? Well, everything below is cool in the way that getting things you do everyday done easier and quicker is cool. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003878.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<h3>How to Assign a Drive Letter to an Airport Disk on Windows XP</h3>
							<p class="date">Nov  2, 2009 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_tech.html">Tech</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I&#8217;ve been using a Time Capsule to back up my Mac for some time now, and have been very satisfied. I was wishing that I could run some kind of over-the-air backup for my wife&#8217;s laptop, which runs Windows <span class="caps">XP, </span>too. So I attached a <span class="caps">USB </span>hard drive to the Time Capsule, and tried to mount that on the Windows XP laptop. First I did it the wrong way, and there was much sadness. Then I did it the right way, and life was easy. I couldn&#8217;t find a description of how to do it right in a quick Google search, so here&#8217;s my story. It&#8217;s probably true for an Airport Extreme Base Station too, since that and the Time Capsule are similar.<br />

							<p>Like many people who got a Treo, I was at least somewhat excited that I could sync my e-mail with Outlook using the built-in VersaMail program. While I&#8217;m far too cheap to pay for the unlimited data transmission plan that would allow me to send and receive mail over the cell network, I definitely wanted to sync mail I wanted to keep around for reference with my Treo. Unfortunately, VersaMail failed miserably, sucked completely, and, virus-like, was virturally impossible to uninstall.<br />

							<p><span class="caps">USC </span>offers one of those subscription-based music services, <a href="http://ruckus.com">Ruckus</a>, for just $10/semester to its students. I&#8217;m a cheap-ass motherfucker and $10 hits that cheap-ass spot just right, so I signed up. Heck, it&#8217;s a standard <a href="http://www.playsforsure.com/">Microsoft-based music rental service</a>, so I also thought it would be a fun idea to check and see if I would like renting, rather than <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">buying</a> my music (at least I&#8217;d get to write a review!). The conclusion? The rental model demands an incredibly high level of execution &#8212; a level that&#8217;s absent &#8212; and is uncompelling at the moment. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002410.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<h3>Treo Quest: Success; Or, How To Switch From A Cingular Region To A National Plan, And Upgrade Your Phone (While Outside Your Region)</h3>
							<p class="date">Jun  8, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_tech.html">Tech</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Somehow, despite Cingular&#8217;s best efforts, I have a Treo 650. It amazes me that it wasn&#8217;t easy for me to give them my money, but my plan was from the wrong region (PAC - California) and the Arizona salespeople couldn&#8217;t access my account to either give me an upgrade or switch me to a national, roaming-free plan. So, once you&#8217;re in a Cingular store, how do you switch your region, switch your plan, and walk out with a new phone, at the two year contract discount price? Well, that&#8217;s what this blog entry is for. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001548.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
