				<p>Something sometimes happens in b-school, something that scares me as someone who&#8217;s seen it from the outside. In b-school, there&#8217;s group projects in every class; and, every now and then, there&#8217;s a group member who doesn&#8217;t contribute. News of this individual&#8217;s worthlessness in a group spreads quickly, and, soon, if you mention that person&#8217;s in your team, you get snickers from other hard-working people. Soon, wherever you go, that person is known as a Bad Team Member.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s really amazing how quickly this kind of thing spreads, and a little scary. The grapevine is fast and powerful. But it&#8217;s good, too. I am in a team with one Bad Team Member, and the grapevine told us that he would be, but we ignored the rumors (to our detriment). I wonder if other large organizations work like this? If I took a job at Intel, would I get to learn who was a hard worker and who was a slacker? And what happens to the individual labeled as a Bad Team Member? Is there a second chance? Is there a way to rehabilitate one&#8217;s reputation?</p>

<p>And why am I so worried about the Bad Team Member anyway? Shouldn&#8217;t I be glad others are lableled as such, for my convenience? Because it is nice to know &#8212; if someone&#8217;s not going to produce, I&#8217;d rather know up front, so that I don&#8217;t have to worry about it and can just go and do their work myself. &#8216;Cause, let&#8217;s face it, I&#8217;ll do as much work as you put in front of me. And that, my friend, is my problem.</p>
