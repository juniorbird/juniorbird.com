				<p>I&#8217;ve rescheduled my Kenan-Flagler interview. I&#8217;m pretty sure I did the right thing canceling due to my sickness &#8212; I just don&#8217;t think there was any way I could have impressed the interviewer. I&#8217;m not sure that I did the right thing in rescheduling a phone, rather than in person, interview.</p>
				
				<p>Ideally, I&#8217;d like to minimize my trips to other cities while still getting a good feel for schools. <span class="caps">UNC </span>is in Chapel Hill, North Carolina &#8212; a nice place, but all the way across the country from me, and I&#8217;d rather not fly there more often than I need to, if only to save money. So I took their offer to interview by phone &#8212; they say phone interviews are regarded equally with in-person interviews. I&#8217;ll still be flying back later, if accepted, to check the place out.</p>

<p>I do wonder if I made the right choice. It&#8217;s probably easier to make an impact in a face-to-face interview, and probably easier for an admissions officer to match a real remembered person than a disembodied voice to an application. We&#8217;ll see how this turns out &#8212; if I don&#8217;t get in, I&#8217;ll be apt to blame the interview. Not that I&#8217;m a shoo-in to be admitted, but, if it doesn&#8217;t work out, I&#8217;ll know when I might not have put my most impactful foot forward.</p>
