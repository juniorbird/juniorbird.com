				<p>Another year, another [set descriptor] of [thing meaningful to you]. I actually enjoyed setting goals last year, and it turns out that <a href="http://cleverbird.com/pwyky/Milestonegoals">setting goals makes you more likely to accomplish something than winging it</a>, so let&#8217;s make some New Year&#8217;s Resolutions again this year.</p>

<h3>Last Year&#8217;s Resolutions Reviewed</h3>

<p>There&#8217;s little sense setting goals without looking at previous goals and seeing how those turned out. My <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/000353.html">resolutions last year were</a>:</p>


<ol>
<li>Exercise more often<br />
<em>Did a pretty good job of this, except for the last quarter of school.</em></li>
<li>Take a Spanish conversation class<br />
<em>Nope. Must do this before <a href="http://www.marshall.usc.edu/web/Prime.cfm?doc_id=3269">going to Santiago and Rio</a> this summer.</em></li>
<li>Use my Sur La Table gift card for cooking classes<br />
<em>Oh yeah, I have that?</em></li>
<li>Learn Python<br />
<em>Success! Learned a lot, wrote about 1/3 of a really cool to do-tracking program.</em></li>
<li>Start a wiki<br />
<em>Yep, <a href="http://cleverbird.com">done</a> that.</em></li>
<li>Blog more regularly<br />
<em>I&#8217;m too lazy to count, but I don&#8217;t think I blogged <strong>less</strong>. As good as could be expected given school.</em></li>
<li>Get it in writing beforehand<br />
<em>Yep yep. Best lesson of all.</em></li>
<li><em>Doveryay, no proverya</em><br />
<em>Nope, I neglected to &#8220;verify&#8221; again this year and, again, got burnt by somebody I thought I could trust.</em></li>
<li>Go to Europe<br />
<em>Nope, decided to hang out at home instead; would have been the right decision if I&#8217;d executed it well.</em></li>
<li>Get friends together for drinks regularly<br />
<em>That would be nice, huh?</em></li>
<li>Not speak ill of those who deserve it<br />
<em>Done.</em></li>
<li>Network, network, network<br />
<em>Done, although not any more than last year &#8212; I did a lot of networking last year.</em></li>
</ol>



<p>Seven out of twelve &#8212; if I could bat that well, they&#8217;d pay me the big bucks. Not bad for the first resolutions ever.</p>

<h3>This Year&#8217;s Resolutions</h3>

<p>Based on the previous set of resolutions, and drawing on new experiences and hopes, here&#8217;s some resolutions for this year:</p>


<ol>
<li>Set aside specific, scheduled time, several days a week, to exercise. Let&#8217;s be more specific than last year, and so hopefully accomplish more.</li>
<li>Get, and stay, on a diet that helps me eat right. One hard thing about school is how often I grab what I can and in what quantities I can. I will get and stay on a diet that works with reality but helps me make the right decisions.</li>
<li>Take a Spanish class. See above.</li>
<li>Update my <a href="http://cleverbird.com">wiki</a> more often. It&#8217;s a tool for me, a place where I can write down stuff I need to keep track of. I need to regularly use it as such. Maybe a daily &#8220;wiki time&#8221;?</li>
<li>Call my grandmother more often.</li>
<li>Keep better track of my finances. My existing system, which had worked well for several years, just didn&#8217;t survive contact with the enemy &#8212; b-school is too time-intensive to spend three-quarters of day a month keeping everything up-to-date. I need a better system.</li>
<li>Use my Sur La Table card for cooking classes. I can do this during the school year if I pick the right days!</li>
<li>Set up a monthly drinks or dinner group with my friends. Especially my school friends need to not talk about class all the time.</li>
<li>Set up a monthly or bi-weekly poker game with my friends. I&#8217;ve been in this poker game put on by some friends at school but the time is basically impossible for me. I need to start my own at a good time for me.</li>
<li><em>Doveryay, no proverya</em>. Again, since I did such a bad job this year.</li>
<li>Network. I probably need to set aside time each week to do networking things.</li>
</ol>



<p>That&#8217;s a long list, but I think worth it. Best of all, like any good to-do list, most of the above resolutions are simple and all are specific.</p>

<p>What are your new year&#8217;s resolutions?</p>

                    <p>I like poker, I also like single biz school guys. Well&#8230; with a few exceptions, like ones that are totally in love with my friends and those who were once cheerleaders.</p>
