				<p>While on the campaign trail, I thought I would take a break and see an <a href="http://http://www.tayshaurquhart.com/Blog/">old friend</a> for dinner. My car drove me and my chief of staff along the 1, up the curves of the coast, to a restaurant on the top of a small rise overlooking the Pacific. Inside, we ate a grand gourmet repast.</p>

<p>Sadly, at the end of the meal my stomach was a bit upset. On the last of a few trips to the bathroom, three beautiful college girls asked me if I was ok. I admitted that I was experencing some stomach distress, and, after some flirtatious banter, one of the women offered me three pills from her handbag. Somewhat sheepish, I took them and, back at the table, added them to a pocket of my backpack that was filled with Advil.</p>

<p>Later, chatting with the three women and having a cocktail on the large lawn of the restaurant, I saw a police officer approaching. I looked over and saw my chief of staff; &#8220;I needed to do this now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to stop the problem before it got too late.&#8221; The cop cuffed my hands in front of me, and grabbed my backpack to search it. &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe you did this to me,&#8221; I screamed, as I shoved my Chief Of Staff against a portico&#8217;s pillar and battered him with my cuffed hands. </p>

<p>After a few blows, and with my Chief of Staff mostly unharmed, my anger subsided. It was replaced by tremendous regret, regret that I had accepted those three pills. I had only accepted them out of politeness, and hadd never planned to take them, but those pills were in my bag. What were they &#8212; were they prescription medication, over-the-counter medication, or illegal drugs? Would the cop find them? Would my campaign end, and my downfall be assured, by my Chief Of Staff&#8217;s betrayal and my own overly-friendly acceptance of the pills?</p>

<p>Of course, I will never know, because then I woke up.</p>
