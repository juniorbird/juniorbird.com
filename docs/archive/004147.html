				<p>I know the moment I shook off the stomach flu: 12:30am, Tuesday, March 20. That was when my eyes - eyes that had been sound asleep for more than two hours, now - popped open. And my brain said: &#8220;let&#8217;s get at it!&#8221;</p><p>We&#8217;d had big St. Patrick&#8217;s Day plans; that&#8217;s what happens when you marry an Irish woman. But I was excited about them: we were going fun places, eating delicious and indulgent food, and who cares if I&#8217;m not a beer guy? green makes everything funner!</p><p>But, oh, then my stomach. I won&#8217;t inflict the details upon you - by &#8220;you&#8221; I mean &#8221; co-worker who&#8217;s only vaguely familiar with me but has tracked down this blog - but I&#8217;m sure you can project a story from your own experiences that was only somewhat worse and far, far funnier to you and your direct acquaintances. </p><p>Anyway, this stomach flu kept me napping all Sunday, and quiet all today, and I came home threatening early bedtimes until the realities of life - working late, feeding the dogs, keeping the parrot entertained, cultivating my Pinboard - intervened. </p><p>Ok, so I didn&#8217;t make it to bed by 9, but my eyes were closed by 10:30. So imagine my shock when I woke up at 12:30 and my brain said, clearly, to my disbelieving body: time to do all those things we planned to do this weekend. </p><p>At 1am? On a school night? Said my body, as it tried to roll over and go back to sleep. </p><p>Yes, said my brain, affecting a proper British headmaster&#8217;s accent, to get it&#8217;s point over. </p><p>And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m up at 1:30 working on a writing project, of which this blog is only a side effect. But at least I know when I beat that darned flu!</p>
