							<h3>New House: Nook</h3>
							<p class="date">Dec 28, 2003 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_otherwise_uncategorized.html">Otherwise Uncategorized</a></p>
						    	
							<p>My house has a nook. Technically, it&#8217;s a breakfast or a dining nook, but I didn&#8217;t put a table in there, so no eating terms can correctly be associated with&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000351.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p class="date">Dec 28, 2003 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_otherwise_uncategorized.html">Otherwise Uncategorized</a></p>
						    	
							<p>Everybody loves bathrooms. It&#8217;s the most important room in any place, when you think about it, because it&#8217;s the one room that, when you need, you really need. Well, <span class="caps">I&#8230; </span><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000350.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>So, as noted in the last entry, every Christmas we go out of town and stay in a hotel. This year was no different, with Christmas celebrated at my grandmother&#8217;s&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000349.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Transcript = Business Model</h3>

							<p>For some reason, business schools seem to actually want proof that I&#8217;ve gained academic success in the past, so I&#8217;ve ordered transcripts from all two of the colleges I&#8217;ve attended&#8230;. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000348.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>I love Christmas! Starting in about, oh, July, I quietly sing Christmas songs to myself. When the season comes along, I&#8217;m like a little child; I even look forward to&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000347.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>This was going to be an entry about how nice it was to visit my grandmother in Houston get a good, simple steak, from a good cut of meat, which&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000346.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Nobody ever told me that, when I grew up, I&#8217;d have to be continually revising my resum&eacute;. New jobs, new areas of concentration, and now business school &#8212; everybody wants&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000345.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>About a month and a half ago, I moved into a new place. It&#8217;s a little house I found for rent about two miles away from where I used to&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000344.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>A Roast! A Roast! My Kingdom For A Roast!</h3>
							<p class="date">Dec 16, 2003 in </p>
						    	
							<p>My favorite cooking method is probably roasting. It&#8217;s simple, it&#8217;s tasty, it&#8217;s easy, and it&#8217;s good for so many different foods. I love roasting and find it a lot of&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000342.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Sundays are good days to have something out-of-the-ordinary for breakfast. It&#8217;s impossible to be too motivated to work on the last day of rest, football is on the <span class="caps">TV, </span>and,&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000339.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
							
							
				
					
				
							<h3>Oh Those Recommendations</h3>

							<p>Applying to business school is, apparently, hard work! All of my free time this week has disappeared into recommendations, transcript requests, and the various administrativa of assembling my applications.

							<p>It&#8217;s getting cold as winter hits even Southern California, so I wanted something nice and thick and warm for dinner this week. Lentils are a great winter treat, and <span class="caps">I&#8230; </span><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000340.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>For all its ubiquity, the Web is not the Internet&#8217;s killer app &#8212; e-mail is. Every day, more bytes of e-mail messages than bytes of html documents transit the net&#8230;. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000335.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Business school applications have a lot of pieces, and I sure don&#8217;t want to miss any of them. So I decided to get organized. Getting organized is a wonderful thing:&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000334.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p class="date">Dec  6, 2003 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_food.html">Food</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I have the tremendously useful ability to eat the same leftovers day after day for nearly an entire week. This is convenient and money-saving, because I can buy food in&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000333.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>After a brief but successful flirtation, I&#8217;ve been asked to uninstall Mozilla Firebird, which I had been using as my primary browser.

							<p>I had to make a visit to the doctor&#8217;s office, so I climbed the stairs to the fourth floor of the building.
