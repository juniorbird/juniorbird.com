				<p>A defining feature of my recent life is dietary restrictions. I&#8217;m allergic to something (not yet determined, so I avoid a lot), and my girlfriend&#8217;s on the Atkins diet. There&#8217;s not a lot of things we can eat, and even fewer things we can both eat together.</p>

<p>So, the other night, when we ran errands and hung out and suddenly realized that, gosh, it was late and we should have dinner already &mdash; well, that was trouble. The little woman didn&#8217;t have much in the fridge, and we&#8217;d planned to shop but had never gotten around to it. What could we eat?</p>

<p>The shopping-free dinner is a fun challenge in and of itself. And, here, we had additional limitations of what ingredients I could eat and how little carbs she could have. I rummaged through the fridge and the pantry, and came up with a simple recipe for fried chicken strips:</p>

<p>Emergency Backup Chicken Strips<br />
2 Chicken Breasts<br />
2 Eggs<br />
2 1/2 T Peanut Butter<br />
2 1/2  t Mustard (a fancier kind, not the plain yellow good-on-hot-dogs type &mdash; you want the additional flavor)<br />
Salt<br />
Pepper<br />
Cayenne Pepper<br />
Peanut, Soybean or Safflower Oil to fry in</p>

<p>1. Cut the chicken in thin strips<br />
2. Mix the ingredients except the chicken and oil until well-combined<br />
3. Dip the chicken in the breading<br />
4. Heat the oil &#8216;til smoking<br />
5. Fry on each side &#8216;til brown<br />
6. Remove to paper towels and drain</p>

<p>Mmm! Look, the girlfriend couldn&#8217;t wait for me to take the picture before she ate them!</p>

                    <p>hey, I&#8217;m on atkins too. and I&#8217;ve gotten REALLY GOOD at cooking nothing but protein and salad.  Tell Brenda she&#8217;s invited to come over and eat with me.  give her my contact info.   I promise there won&#8217;t be three-chocolate cake in the house.  (mmmmmmm that was some good cake, huh?!  I remember cake&#8230;&#8230;)</p>

                    <p>I&#8217;ll give her your info, and I&#8217;ll be fascinated to see what your menus look like! I&#8217;m not averse to protein-heavy cooking myself - I love to roast - but the most fun thing is always new ideas. Brenda has been on Atkins before, and it really worked for her, but for some reason this time it&#8217;s not. I bet an infusion of new recipes would surely help!</p>
