				<p>We &#8212; that is, myself, the various madly-retreating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franquism">Spanish Nationalist</a> troops with which I was traveling, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franquism">Generalissimo Francisco Franco</a> &#8212; were trudging through a lightly-forested area of gently rolling and quite verdant hills. The sky was clear and the sun bright, but we didn&#8217;t expect the three Republican fighters that appeared in the distance, charging towards us.</p>

<p>One fighter after the next dove quickly down, plummeting at a 45&deg; angle as they strafed our disorganized company. I just stood there and watched, enjoying the view as the white planes, with their orange engine cowls and brown wingtips, spatted landing gear, and tails, zipped past<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003665.html#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The planes made five or six strafing passes without hurting anyone, when I began to worry about the Generalissimo<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003665.html#fn2">2</a></sup>. The planes seemed to be approaching from the sun, so I told him to stand right behind a tree that itself stood between us and the sun. As we walked around the tree we saw that there were already 3 or 4 men of South Asian extraction standing there, watching the show in safety. Out of ideas, I suggested the Generalissimo stand a few feet behind those men. Then I walked into the trees to stand back and watch myself.</p>

<p>I was very surprised when the next plane zipped past, not from the sun behind me where I expected it but from my right, flying only 5 or 6 feet off the ground as it traveled down a natural avenue between the trees. Although the two machineguns in its wings sparkled, there was nobody in front of it to get hit; we were all to the side, watching the plane pass (in fact, to this time, nobody had been hurt in the attack).</p>

<p>The plane was so close that I knew I could shoot it down if I just had a gun. &#8220;A pity this is just a dream,&#8221; I thought, &#8220;because, were I really in this situation, I&#8217;d have something to shoot this guy with.&#8221; I straightened my thumb and pointer fingers and pointed them at the plane like a gun. &#8220;Pow, pow, pow&#8221; I said. Suddenly, there was a gun in my hand, and I shot the plane 10 times. I could see the holes in the matte white metal.</p>

<p>Then the dream rewound. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t shoot the plane 10 times, my gun only has 9 rounds!&#8221;<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003665.html#fn3">3</a></sup> The effect of the 10th bullet was magically erased. But, wounded, the plane bellied down into the deep, soft grass. &#8220;I&#8217;d better load another magazine in case I need to shoot the pilot.&#8221; I thought to myself, and so I did, dropping the empty magazine to my left.</p>

<p>Then Wesley Snipes got out of the plane. &#8220;Goddamn it, why did you have to go do that&#8221; he yelled at me, stern, all John Cutter from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105104/-like">Passenger 57</a>. [4] &#8220;We had a great thing going here! We were going to make so much money on the movie. All you had to do was not mess<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003665.html#fn5">5</a></sup> everything up.&#8221; He was walking up on me fast, and I didn&#8217;t like his attitude, so I shot him clear through, just above his heart<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003665.html#fn6">6</a></sup>. </p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> For geeks like me, they looked like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_Ki-15">Ki-15</a> from the back of the wing forward and like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polikarpov_I-16">I-16</a> from the back of the wing to the tail.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn2"><sup>2</sup> Can you think of anybody else with the actual title of Generalissimo besides Franco and Chiang Kai-Shek, two murderous anti-communists of the same era?</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn3"><sup>3</sup> I was wrong; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1911">the gun I imagined only holds 8 shots!</a></p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn4"><sup>4</sup> Always bet on black.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn5"><sup>5</sup> Yes, he did say &#8220;mess.&#8221; Dialogue isn&#8217;t my strength.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn6"><sup>6</sup> Strangely, I didn&#8217;t feel guilty for killing Wesley Snipes when I woke up. But being on Franco&#8217;s side? What&#8217;s up with that?</p>
