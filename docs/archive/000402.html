				<p>Since the <a href="http://wadearmstrong.com/archives/000378.html">Malaysian Tamarind Shrimp</a> went so well, I decided to try another recipe from my <em>Best of Sunset</em> magazine (I&#8217;ve always found that a cookbook that gives one good recipe is filled with other tasty ones). Spicy Mediterranean chicken with a twist? Sign me up! Did it work? Well, suffice it to say that I will be using this magazine more in the future.</p>
				
				<p><a href="http://www.findarticles.com/cf_dls/m1216/2_209/90113793/p1/article.jhtml">Chicken Piri Piri</a> uses a marinade of lemon juice, olive oil, chili flakes and oregano. I always like marinades with a good acid, to break down the meat and let the flavor in, and a good oil, to aid in browning (that&#8217;s where flavor comes from, after all). This marinade didn&#8217;t disappoint:<br />

<p>Now, the recipe suggested grilling. But we all know that the grill is just an outdoor broiler, so this dish was an obvious broil choice. But the broiler has a dark side: it&#8217;ll brown the heck out of the surface of your foodstuff but, often, at too high a rate to cook the inside fully. The solution: bake it first. I put the (boneless, skinless) chicken breasts in the oven at 350&deg; for 15 minutes.<br />

<p>After that, the juices from the chicken were running just pink (a done chicken has clear-running juices when cut). Into the broiler for 10 minutes and it comes out great.</p>

<p>Meanwhile: the sauce. Marinades can be reused as sauce if brought to, and held at, a boil for a bit. Keep the marinade at said boil and it reduces to a nice thick sauce. Unless, as with the piri-piri, it contains an acid and an oil with no liaison. The recipe recommends butter, but I&#8217;m allergic to cow&#8217;s milk. I thought of using mustard, to make a vinaigrette, but mustards add flavor. I settled on a roux of flour and more oil (the starch in the flour would liaise the sauce). But how much roux to substitute for the butter? I decided to go with an equal amount. Tragically, that was too much; the sauce thickened within seconds to, at best, a tapenade. I quickly added a little frozen chicken stock (I freeze mine in icecube trays to always have some on hand &#8212; even a few quarts will last for months) and some water, and the sauce thinned to a good gravy.</p>

<p>The result: a wonderful dish!<br />
