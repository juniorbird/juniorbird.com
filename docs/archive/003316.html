				<p>My father, who writes about issues in education in <a href="http://www.changinghighereducation.com/">his blog</a>, recently suggested that <a href="http://www.changinghighereducation.com/2006/03/what_business_a.html">universities are in the knowledge supply chain management business</a>. That made me ask myself: if there is a knowledge supply chain, then there must somewhere be an inventory of knowledge, right? My father argues that <a href="http://www.changinghighereducation.com/2007/04/who_are_our_cus.html">inventory is held in the universities</a>, which create and collect knowledge, but I&#8217;d say that knowledge inventory is much more held in the hands of university graduates, who store knowledge in case their employers ever need it. This just-in-time inventory system allows businesses to avoid investing in knowledge creation and management, but means that individuals &#8212; the player with the least ability to pay &#8212; are stuck holding the inventory and paying the purchase and holding cost thereof. As college educations become more expensive, we must shift knowledge inventory-holding from individuals and to universities; if universities help us do this, they can make more money doling out that knowledge to in a just-in-time manner than they do pushing that inventory into the personal inventory of hundreds of thousands of grads every year.</p>
