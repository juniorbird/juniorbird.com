							<h3>Baltimore Inner Harbor Pictures</h3>
							<p class="date">Aug 31, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_travel.html">Travel</a></p>
						    	
							<p>I know you all would like some actual textual content, but I don&#8217;t have time tonight &#8212; which means you&#8217;re stuck with more photos of <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/001649.php">Baltimore</a>. Fortunately for you, there&#8217;s only two more galleries left. Until I get my photos from Tucson back, that is. Anway, until then, enjoy the nautical attractions of Baltimore&#8217;s lovely downtown Inner Harbor. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001802.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>Tired of my travel photos yet? Not me! Here is the first of four sets of pictures from my trip to Baltimore. These are just general pictures of the city&#8230; <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001800.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>In sixth grade, I switched schools. Rite of passage, sure, but the hard part (insofar as I had minimal-to-no social skills) was to make friends. Somehow, I ended up part of a band of misfits. There was Blaise, the brilliant Spaniard; Larry, the incredibly creative son of a chicken parts magnate; John, the business-focused Korean; and me. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001794.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<h3>Mexico City Templo Mayor Pictures</h3>
							<p class="date">Aug 29, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_travel.html">Travel</a></p>
						    	
							<p>This is it &#8212; the very last set of photos from Mexico City. I has a <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/001619.php">great trip</a> there, and I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed the photos at least 10% as much as I enjoyed taking them. What follows is photos of the ruins of the ancient Aztec <em>Templo Mayor</em>, the center of life in old Tenochtitlan. If you haven&#8217;t figured out by now that clicking zooms, then I have no idea what to do with you. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001795.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>While, someday soon, we may actually have textual content, for the moment I&#8217;m not in the mood. So, more pics from <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/001619.php">Mexico City</a>. Don&#8217;t worry; there&#8217;s only one gallery of these left (and four from my <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/001649.php">trip to Baltimore</a>). If you click on these photos, Smugmug will offer you many added features. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001790.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<h3>Mexico City Anthropology Museum Photos</h3>
							<p class="date">Aug 25, 2005 in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/cat_photos.html">Photos</a></p>
						    	
							<p>When in <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/001619.php">Mexico City</a>, I was lucky enough to visit the Anthropology museum and see native dancers and <em>voladores</em>. Here are these sights, thanks to modern technology compressed to fit on your computer screen, and enlargable with just a click.<br />

							<p>One of Mexico&#8217;s most famous recent monuments (that is, excepting the Aztec and Maya ruins) is the <em>Ninos Heroes</em> in the <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/001619.php">Bosque de Chapultepec</a>. It&#8217;s a very proud monument for such a sad story. I&#8217;ve done my best to take proud, nationalist photos of it, despite being from the nation that inspired the cadets&#8217; <em>jette&eacute;</em>. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001775.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>In <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/001619.php">Mexico City&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/001765.php">Bosque de Chapultepec</a> you&#8217;ll find the Castillo de Chapultepec, home of many of Mexico&#8217;s governments, including the initial Revolutionary government, Emperor Maximilian, and most of the Governors-General. It&#8217;s a bizarre hodgepodge of various styles of architecture, with components obviously built by experienced military men with an eye for a defensive position, and components built imitating the styles of the grand French chateaux. The Castillo has a great view of the whole city and is definitely where I&#8217;ll make my home, when I&#8217;m king. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001766.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>The <em>Bosque</em>, or forest, is a large area, around a hill, that has stood green since the time of the Aztecs, and which held the rulers of Mexico City from the time of the Conquistadors to well after the Revolution. Here are a few pictures I took on my <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archives/001619.php">recent trip to <em>el <span class="caps">D.F.</span></em></a> As usual, click to enlarge, etc. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001765.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>After driving and driving on Monday through the desert, I finally got back to my little house in the Palms neighborhood of <span class="caps">LA.</span> I&#8217;d both desperately anticipated and feared my homecoming; I was ready to leave Phoenix but I feared I&#8217;d idealized my home and would be dissapointed by its small size, its rickety construction, its lack of air conditioning, or the ghetto that surrounds it. But my homecoming was everything I&#8217;d hoped. The house was cute (if &#8220;rustic&#8221;, as was commented), it was comfortable, and the neighborhood was vibrant and filled with fun things.

							<p>Humans had gone to the stars, filled with hope, and colonized one planet, many light-years away from Earth. But, as we entered the universe, we made enemies, and one of these enemies attacked earth and rendered it uninhabitable. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001748.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>

							<p>For some reason, I&#8217;m always inspired to put all of my photos of churches in one album. Certainly, churches make for great photos. Well, here&#8217;s the ones I took in Rio. Oh, and for some balance there&#8217;s two pictures from a street that was filled with hookers. Not that I took any pictures of the hookers. Just of the street on which the hookers sat. Frankly, Rio hookers scared me. There&#8217;s probably a future blog entry on that. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/001740.html">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
