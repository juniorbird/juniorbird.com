				<p>It&#8217;s kind of astounding how much time is completely unproductive when a baby&#8217;s around. I used to have my <a href="https://trello.com/">vast to-do list</a> and every free minute involved pulling the next thing off the top of the list and getting it going. Or screwing around and reading <a href="http://fark.com">Fark</a>. Or perhaps some combination of the two. At any rate, there was always a pretense towards productivity. Since Declan came along? Not a bit.</p><p>My lifestyle has changed, in that now I spend hours a day doing nothing but watching <span class="caps">TV.</span> No watching TV and doing my e-mail, or watching TV and paying bills: I&#8217;m just straight watching the <span class="caps">TV.</span> Oh, and holding my son. We&#8217;re watching TV together and sometimes he&#8217;s even eating. See, I&#8217;m not the one who&#8217;s productive anymore.</p><p>My life is very much about waiting for whatever Declan needs. Starting on something while I&#8217;m waiting for him? Not a good use of my time; I&#8217;ll just end up interrupted and won&#8217;t finish. Like this blog entry, for instance &#8212; I started it yesterday and was interrupted by a feeding. I can see my boy starting to stir right now and I know in a minute or two he&#8217;ll be awake and need a changing and a bottle again, and this entry won&#8217;t be finished until tomorrow.</p><p>So tonight I won&#8217;t get my very important tasks, like putting a couple of extra screws in that old Barcalounger so that it doesn&#8217;t fall apart. But I sure will sit in that Barcalounger, rickety as it is, and feed my son a bottle while we watch some great TV together. My to-do list will remain untouched, but Declan will practice his eating and his stretching and maybe, if we&#8217;re both lucky, his head-lifting. And it&#8217;s his to-do list that&#8217;s important now not mine.</p>
