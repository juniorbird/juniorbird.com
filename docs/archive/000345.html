				<p>Nobody ever told me that, when I grew up, I&#8217;d have to be continually revising my resum&eacute;. New jobs, new areas of concentration, and now business school &#8212; everybody wants my resum&eacute;. And the perpetual topic of conversation and fear of every job-seeker &#8212; is my resum&eacute; up to snuff? Is it good enough? Does it head straight for the circular file or for the hiring manager&#8217;s desk? And, gosh, now I have to figure out how to market myself to business school applications committees.</p>
				
				<p>My resum&eacute; has gone through several distinct evolutions, the most recent coming from extensive contact with a tech recruiter. That was a very useful interaction that left me with a very solid and well-expressed list of accomplishments. The downside: boy was it long, designed to detail every single accomplishment for potential employers. So I had to pare it down and tune it for b-school.</p>

<p>I considered putting together a distinct resum&eacute; for each school to which I applied, but I was not convinced that approach would add much value. My core set of messages is the same across each application &#8212; the goal, after all, is to express who I am. So the main task was to cut redundant information while still showing the wide range of tasks I&#8217;d carried out in past jobs. I also had to add in new information to beef up my academic credentials, which I hadn&#8217;t had to emphasize for my previous job searches.</p>

<p>Based on all this, I have a two-and-a-half page resum&eacute;. That seems a bit longer than ideal, but I&#8217;ve really had a wider range of responsibilities than most applicants of the same age.</p>

<p>My next task is to run this resum&eacute; past a few people I know, in particular one HR consultant I know. I&#8217;d like to make sure it&#8217;s impactful and grammatically correct. But, in the spirit of providing a record with which to embarrass myself and, hopefully, help other applicants, <a href="/files/resume1.doc">here&#8217;s draft one of my resum&eacute;</a></p>

<p>The oddest thing to me is that it&#8217;s a Word .doc (well only to an extent &#8212; I created it using <a href="http://openoffice.org">OpenOffice</a>, which can open and save Word .docs). Ever since I was in college I&#8217;ve created my resum&eacute;s in <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/"><span class="caps">BBE</span>dit</a>, a text editor, and <a href="http://www.quark.com/products/xpress/">Quark XPress</a>, a page-layout application. Using the two documents has a few big advantages &#8212; creating copy in the text editor, which affords no formatting, makes it easier to concentrate just on the copy; then XPress, of course, is the premier page-layout application for a reason, so I can make the document look howsoever I feel will best emphasize the information.</p>

<p>But many schools want me to upload my resum&eacute;, and, for best compatibility, it appears that a Word .doc is the best way to store my resum&eacute;. So I&#8217;ll downgrade both my text-handling and my page-layout capabilities to do what is, after all, really important &#8212; communicate.</p>
