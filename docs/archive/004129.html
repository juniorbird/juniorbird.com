				<p>Habati from Africa! At least, I think that&#8217;s the word. It&#8217;s kind of hard to tell details like &#8220;what&#8217;s the language&#8221; and &#8220;where am I?&#8221; and &#8220;what time is it?&#8221; after a flight halfway around the world.See, we left the house at 2:30pm and then finally arrived at our destination at 9:30am two days later. Taking into account time change fun, that totals up to about 30 hours in four airports, three planes, and a Toyota Land Cruiser.</p><p>It all started in <span class="caps">LAX</span>&#8217;s Tom Bradley International Terminal, which was a wonderful reminder of just how much of a shithole <span class="caps">LAX </span>actually is. I&#8217;d last flown out of that terminal probably six years ago, when much of the construction was still ongoing (for instance: the big <span class="caps">TSA </span>luggage x-ray machines were right at the front of the building, because that was the only place that there was room, which also meant a building-long line of people waiting for checked luggage clearance that you had to somehow make your way past before you could even get to the line for the check-in counter). I was excited to see the new Tom Bradley International Terminal, with its many restaurants and shops that the wife and I could pass hours in as we waited for our flight.<br /><br />So we arrived, responsibly, a bit more than 3 hours early (driven by the only good cab driver I&#8217;ve had since 1993 in <span class="caps">LA, </span>by the way, or at least only the second one who knew where he was going; he got a big holiday tip). And security was fast and we got right in to the gates area. And then we discovered that the restaurants were actually <strong>outside</strong> the gates, and there was almost nothing to do inside. Well-played, <span class="caps">LAX, </span>well-played: you almost made me forget what a shithole you are with your nice, clean Tom Bradley International Terminal.<br /><br />But it was actually <span class="caps">OK, </span>because we&#8217;d had a pretty outstanding experience checking in for our flight. And how many times have you ever said that? We flew Turkish Airlines &#8212; you may not know, since we didn&#8217;t, that they won Best Airline in Europe last year &#8212; mostly because they met the big two priorities we had:</p><ul><li>Reasonable Price</li><li>Layover less than 8 hours</li></ul><p>In addition, they had an add-on bonus that didn&#8217;t contribute to our selection of them but certainly made us more excited: a brand-new <a href="http://www.turkishairlines.com/en-US/passenger/index.aspx#ComfortClass" target="_blank">premium economy section </a>that they were selling at almost-economy prices, and that we could fly on our first leg, the preposterously-long <span class="caps">LAX</span>-Istanbul non-stop route. When we arrived for check-in, we discovered an entire queue set up just for premium economy, so we sped to the counter. Once there, we had to talk to a nice lady in ticketing; as she started to help us, she repeated our names back to us, which resulted in the nice lady next to her saying &#8220;Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong! I know you. Your ticket is right here!&#8221; <br /><br />That&#8217;s right, apparently we&#8217;re so important that the desk agents at Turkish Airlines recognize us straight away. I assume that this is because my wife works in TV; all fame in LA comes from <span class="caps">TV.</span> At least, I assume it&#8217;s not because the agent has a thing for content management systems.<br /><br />Thus, despite the continuing incompetence of LA World Airports, we were able to enjoy our sojourn at the gate with a reserve of good attitude. And then, speaking of good attitude, we got on the plane.<br /><br />When we bought premium economy, we pretty much expected what we saw on other domestic airlines: a couple of inches more seat pitch, some premium in-flight entertainment, and business-class food. Maybe free booze too, if we were lucky. What we didn&#8217;t expect &#8212; and what we saw as soon as we walked in &#8212; was pretty much what they called &#8220;Business Class&#8221; 10 years ago. With a probably inappropriate level of oohing and aahing, we sat down &#8212; me next to the window, Court along the aisle, in a 2+4+2 widebody configuration &#8212; and then suddenly realized that I could get up and walk past my wife to get to, say, the bathroom<em> without her actually having to leave her seat</em>. And there was a footrest. And those little reading lights on the flexible stalks. And a ton of recent movies on the inflight entertainment.</p><p><br /><br /><img height="450" src="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/Tanzania-2011-2012/Getting-There/i-wCf7p3R/0/M/P1010086-M.jpg" width="600" /></p><p>And, just when we thought it couldn&#8217;t get any better, the cabin crew brought us our dinner menu. So that we could make our selections. It looked delicious &#8212; when was the last time you said that about an airline menu? &#8212; and we were excited. Then it came, and it was delicious, with a salad with good-quality feta and fresh olive oil, and great chicken and fish, and delicious rice and sauce and veggies, and free whisky for the both of us.</p><p><img height="450" src="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/Tanzania-2011-2012/Getting-There/i-LxxGdJz/0/M/P1010091-M.jpg" width="600" /><br /><br /><br />The upshot is: the next time you only have 24-30 hours for vacation, you might just want to book a round-trip on Turkish Air and enjoy the free movies, the delicious food, the friendly cabin crew, and the outrageous seats. Apart from the risk of thrombosis, I think I could&#8217;ve spent three weeks on that flight!</p><p><img height="450" src="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/Tanzania-2011-2012/Getting-There/i-hNZtf2M/0/M/P1010089-M.jpg" width="600" /><br /><br />Flying from Istanbul to Dar Es Salaam, the commercial capital of Tanzania, wasn&#8217;t quite as luxurious, but we still got to travel on a brand-new 737-900. And the meals were good again, even the breakfast that came in your standard airline box. Which just begs the question: why does anyone ever take a US carrier? Or, more than that, why are US carriers so awful?<br /><br />We landed at 3am at the very relaxed, very tropical Dar airport, waited in line for a while to get a very nifty-looking visa stamped into our passports &#8212; it even has our photos on it! &#8212; and then hung out on a bench waiting for check-in to open for our final leg of our flight, about 3 hours later. So we waited and read &#8212; and I accidentally walked around security and off practically onto a boarding walkway, but they were very nice about it &#8212; and finally got in a nice, quick line to check in with local low-cost carrier Precision Air.<br /><br />Again, the flight was lovely, with smiling cabin attendants who somehow pulled off their yellow-and-lime-green uniforms and comfortable-enough seats even on the little <span class="caps">ATR </span>turboprop. Luckily enough, we were even seated on the right side of the plane to get a view of Mt. Kilimanjaro as we went in to land.<br /><br />The Kilimanjaro airport made Dar, with its actual multiple floors and gates and queues seem bustling. In minutes our bags were up and we found a nice man with a sign that said &#8220;Armstrong Wade&#8221; (my name order is surprisingly unclear when coming at it from another culture, actually) and a big, tan Toyota Land Cruiser. He took us down well-maintained highways, past a town with a market days and past a bunch of guys on good-looking motorcycles with chrome polished to a rare shine &#8212; to our first destination: the lodge at the Moivaro Coffee Plantation, just a bit outside of Tazania&#8217;s resort center of Arusha and about 3000 feet up the side of Kilimanjaro.</p><p><img height="400" src="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/Tanzania-2011-2012/Moivaro/i-b7mjsHM/0/M/IMG5922-M.jpg" width="600" /><br /><br />Which is where I&#8217;m writing you from, enjoying a caramel-y Serengeti Lager while Court savors her crisp-yet-nutty Kilimanjaro lager, on a verandah while the sun goes down around us, the birds whistle in the nearby jungle, and the locusts chirp a soothing story. Tonight, it&#8217;s luxury under a mosquito net in our little hut. Because, after thirty hours, it&#8217;s been well time.</p><p><img height="400" src="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/Tanzania-2011-2012/Moivaro/i-TWZT9xH/0/M/IMG5909-M.jpg" width="600" /></p>
