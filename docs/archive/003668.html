				<p>Had a nice service for <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003594.html">my friend Rick</a> earlier today. Driving home, I came out of the strip mall flats of Inglewood and through the tangle of I-405 on-ramps and suddenly the sky was bright and a bank of cotton candy-fluffy white clouds sat just to my west, halfway to the ocean.</p>

<p>It was nice to see family and friends at the funeral. His youngest daughters are doing well, thank goodness &#8212; taken in by his eldest daughter, they&#8217;re in a loving and positive home. And everyone&#8217;s lives there seemed to be moving forward, with new jobs and new homes and growth all around. As with anyone, as Rick&#8217;s life took a turn for the worse, all of us around him felt some pain; but it was good to see everyone remember not that part of Rick, but the caring friend with a good heart. In the moment of his passing he was possessed by darkness, and I was sad and angry that side had won; but, in the service today, I saw that it was the good that triumphed. Whether or not having that triumph in the hearts of others is worth it I&#8217;ll leave as an exercise for someone more inclined towards philosophy.</p>

                    <p>Hey, Rick&#8217;s service was extremely touching and it was REALLY good to see alllll the kids and grand-kids in good spirits (my son is one of his grandkids.) I know even though it took almost 3 months to have it he know&#8217;s his baby girls were priority and with them being taken care of by Danielle and her fiance&#8217;s family, Rick can really rest in paradise&#8230;when i saw you i thought you worked at the church..nice suit..did you have a brownie =) ????</p>
