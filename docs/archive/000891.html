				<p>I am on the starship Enterprise, from the Next Generation TV show (a fine show, even if <a href="http://brenditabonita.blogspot.com/">certain people</a> think it&#8217;s boring). We find a spaceship (is it an alternative Enterprise? I&#8217;m not sure) stuck in between two dimensions, partially in ours and partially in another. This ship moves close to us to transfer its crew over; &#8220;it must be so horrible to be trapped between dimensions, they&#8217;ll try anything,&#8221; says Captain Picard.</p>

<p>Their ship touches ours, at the bottom of our saucer section, then winks out of existence. Picard and I ride the turbolift down to see who we&#8217;ve taken on board. At the bottom of the turbolift shaft, the door doesn&#8217;t open; I am about to force it when Picard pushes on the door; it flexes in and out like the safety button in the middle of a juice bottle&#8217;s cap. The area outside is depressurized; the bottom two levels of the saucer section were opened to space when the other ship disappeared. If I had opened the turbolift door, Picard and I would have been killed.</p>

<p>After a few anxious moments, the turbolift takes us back up to the bottom &#8220;living&#8221; level. I comment how awful it would have been to get stuck down at the bottom floor; Picard agrees.</p>

<p>Now the day is over, so I leave the turbolift and go to sleep on my bunk, a hospital gurney in the middle of the deck, which is open from one end of the ship to the other. Nobody is there. I turn out the lights. In the middle of the night I wake up with the feeling somebody is watching me. Nobody is there, but there&#8217;s a tricorder on the floor, its screen glowing in the darkness.</p>

<p>Are the people from the other ship really gone? Am I really alone?</p>
