				<p>So at the <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/003702.html">Housewarming Party</a> the <a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/gallery/3054487_JzRG2/1/166319766_anwr9">dog</a> walked out the front door, took a left turn, and went absentmindedly exploring down the block. A neighbor a few houses down fortunately recognized him and came by carrying the little guy. Let me tell you that finding a black dog in the middle of the night did not sound like a good bet at the time and we were sure happy to see the pup. Then, as we were setting up for last night&#8217;s combined Halloween/AIG&#8217;s Birthday party, a <a href="http://identify.whatbird.com/obj/36/_/Coopers_Hawk.aspx">Cooper&#8217;s Hawk</a> suddenly swept down from the sky gunning straight for <a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/gallery/1437283_4rCYr/1/68344502_yTuCP">Junior</a>.</p>

<p>I was about six feet away and in no position to do anything about it. Junior saw the hawk well before me and went into <a href="http://www.strayreality.com/birding_directory_site/birding/umbrellatoo.jpg">full display</a> and let loose his loudest alarm call. All of a sudden, the hawk just hung there in the air, with his target suddenly looking twice as large as when he began his dive; I could see the characteristic round tail shape and the blue-gray basic coloring and the barred tail. And then the hawk&#8217;s wings got lift and he swooped away, clearing the wall between our house and the neighbor&#8217;s by about a foot and apparently shooting just over the neighbors&#8217; heads on the way to whatever tree he&#8217;d been sitting in. Junior wasn&#8217;t worked up; I guess he&#8217;s just so used to assuming he&#8217;ll be eaten (he is a prey animal after all) that he thought actual peril was no different from just any other day.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the party we threw went great. I made an aioli and sauteed mushrooms and boiled potatoes to dip in it, and we served <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_%27N%27_Stormy">Dark n&#8217; Stormies</a>, <a href="http://drinkboy.com/Cocktails/recipes/Diabolo.html">Diabolos</a>, and <a href="http://www.idrink.com/v.html?id=1357">Black Witches</a>. We even had some fun decorating the place:</p>

<p>And the birthday celebration was wonderful, with the <span class="caps">AIG&#8217;</span>s favorite carrot cake and a delicious flan cake as well:</p>

<p>It was a great Halloween, but I hope I don&#8217;t have another one as scary soon! And, worse, now we&#8217;ve had peril to both the pets in both of our parties. Who&#8217;s next? Does it rotate back to Jake, or is it going to be trouble for me or for the Most Important Pet, the <span class="caps">AIG</span>?</p>

                    <p>Well, as scary as it was, we sure did have a great party! As for the next one…I don’t know? Do we rent a pet (say, a cat) for a night to decrease our individual odds of peril? </p>
