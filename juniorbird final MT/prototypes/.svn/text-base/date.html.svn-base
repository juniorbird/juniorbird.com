				<h3><a name="002703"> </a>Hey Look, There's A Swift Boat!</h3>
				<p class="date">Jul 21, 2006</p>
			    <p>I was going to the worst place in the world and I didn&#8217;t even know it yet. Weeks away and hundreds of miles up a river that snaked through the war like a main circuit cable - plugged straight into Kurtz.</p>
			
				<p>No wait, sorry, wrong trip up the Mekong. Mine was actually kind of nice. No &#8220;terminate with extreme prejudice&#8221; or anything, although, you should be aware, this entry does not exist, nor will it ever exist.</p>
				
				<p>After <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002696.php">Saigon</a>, my next stop was Cambodia &#8212; specifically, its capital, <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002695.php">Phnom Penh</a>, and the <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002697.php">famous ruins at Angkor Wat</a>. Now, I could fly up there, which was both quick and inexpensive (thank you Vietnam Airlines, Air Asia, and Bangkok Air!), but what fun would that be? No, I decided to take a tour up the Mekong river, seeing the sights and the local minority peoples and drinking with other English-speaking tourists. Yes, it promised to be a bang-up time. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002703.php">Read on&#8230;</a> (<a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002703.php#comments">plus 1 Comments</a>)</p>
		
		
				<h3><a name="002702"> </a>Don't Know How Lucky You Are</h3>
				<p class="date">Jul 20, 2006</p>
		    	<p>I&#8217;m back! That&#8217;s right, I survived four hours of flying from Bangkok to Taipei &#8212; including an unexpected and free upgrade to business class &#8212; followed by a five-hour layover in Taipei, capped off with an eleven hour flight home (it was supposed to be twelve, but I guess we caught a tailwind, which was good since it took an hour for my bag to come off the plane). <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002702.php">Read on&#8230;</a> (<a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002702.php#comments">plus 1 Comments</a>)</p>

				<p class="date">Jul 18, 2006</p>
		    	<p>I&#8217;m back in Bangkok, picking up a few last gifts before I get on a plane home tomorrow (if you&#8217;re reading this entry, it&#8217;s probably too late to put in a request for a tchotchke or a small Thai slave). But it&#8217;s not the tourist goods that I&#8217;m thinking about now, it&#8217;s the evil-looking gray cloud that grabbed my attention as I flew to Bangkok from Chiang Mai. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002701.php">Read on&#8230;</a> (<a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002701.php#comments">plus 2 Comments</a>)</p>
		
		
				<h3><a name="002699"> </a>The Thai Pac-Man Goes...*</h3>
				<p class="date">Jul 17, 2006</p>
		    	<p>Chiang Mai is a small city in Northern Thailand, but Thais seem to think of it like their second city. I came here because it&#8217;s in the hills, and I thought I&#8217;d like a little cool weather to end my vacation. The weather has been quite reasonable for this area, although of course with the humidity of the jungle. Yesterday, I tromped about town &#8212; it only takes a half hour to walk from one end of the old walled city to the other &#8212; visitng as many of the city&#8217;s old and beautiful wats, or Buddhist temples, as possible.  <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002699.php">Read on&#8230;</a> (<a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002699.php#comments">plus 2 Comments</a>)</p>
		
		    
				<h3><a name="002698"> </a>Return to the Land of the Controlled Intersections</h3>
				<p class="date">Jul 15, 2006</p>
		   		<p>I&#8217;m back in Thailand, whose traffic had <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002679.php">scared me a bit</a>, it&#8217;s true, and I&#8217;m still surprised to see the oncoming traffic on my right, not my left, but the fact is that there are lights at the intersections here, and everyone&#8217;s instrument cluster works (how does the entire population of Vietnam get along without a single working gas gauge or dipstick?) so I must be back in civilization! We&#8217;ll see later when I take a moto ride with a friend who I&#8217;ve unexpectedly discovered is living in Chiang Mai. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002698.php">Read on&#8230;</a></p>
		
		    
				<h3><a name="002697"> </a>Best Food Ever</h3>
			    <p class="date">Jul 12, 2006</p>
		    	<p>Until today, I had, in all honesty, been disappointed by the food I&#8217;d had in Cambodia. Khmer cuisine was supposed to be the undiscovered jewel, but it had seemed bland compared to Thai cuisine, which was spicier, or Vietnamese cuisine, which was more flavorful. And then I got a cookie on the street, and had dinner at what is purported to be Mick Jagger&#8217;s favorite place in Siem Reap. That Mick, he&#8217;s a smart man. Oh, and I also saw that wonder of the world, Angkor Wat, etc. etc. etc. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002697.php">Read on&#8230;</a> (<a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002697.php#comments">plus 4 Comments</a>)</p>
				
				
				<h3><a name="002696"> </a>Miss Saigon Traffic Accident</h3>
				<p class="date">Jul 11, 2006</p>
		    	<p>I know I owe you all a few entries from the week I missed back there earlier on my trip, so here&#8217;s part one of two: Saigon/Ho Chi Minh City, also known as &#8220;the expensive place in Vietnam.&#8221; Which is to say, sure, I&#8217;d go back in a minute. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002696.php">Read on&#8230;</a> (<a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002696.php#comments">plus 6 Comments</a>)</p>
