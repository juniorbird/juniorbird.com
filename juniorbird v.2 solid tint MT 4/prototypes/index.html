					<h2>Warning: Source of this Blog May Burst Into Flames</h2>
	
					<p>I write this blog on a two-year-old Dell Latitude <span class="caps"><span class="caps">D600 </span></span>laptop, a laptop which, I am now informed <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/07/28/another-dell-laptop-ignites/">may</a> <a href="http://community.tomshardware.com/dellpost.html?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=192887&amp;ex=Dude-Dell-freaking-blew">vent</a> <a href="http://kd7lrj.blogspot.com/2006/07/dell-laptop-battery-trouble-at-novell.html">with</a> <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=32550">flames</a> &#8212; or, if you&#8217;re not a technology marketer, the battery can explode and catch on fire. Given my <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/000646.php">previous level of satisfaction with Dell products</a>, you can believe that I&#8217;m super-excited and happy about this development. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002722.php">Read on&#8230;</a> (<a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002722.php#comments">plus 1 Comments</a>)</p>

					<p>Now, in all fairness, this is apparently not Dell&#8217;s fault &#8212; Sony made the faulty batteries (just like they made similar flaming batteries for <a href="http://www.tidbits.com/tb-issues/tidbits-295.html#lnk2">Apple&#8217;s PowerBook 5300</a>). And Dell has put up <a href="https://www.dellbatteryprogram.com/Default.aspx">a Web site that helps you check if you need a new battery and ships you one</a>. Much to my surprise, my two-year-old laptop &#8212; which has thus far been flames-free &#8212; qualified for a replacement. Since the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">D600 </span></span>has been available for 30-some months, I wonder how unlikely a fire is, or, alternatively, how many battery fires there have been so far. I hope the answer is &#8220;not many&#8221;, because it&#8217;ll be 20 days before I get my new battery.</p>

					<p>It could be worse, other models take up to 75 days to have batteries ship, and Dell recommends that you remove your battery until you get the new one. Not having a battery in the computer at all won&#8217;t make much of a difference in my battery life, anyway, since Windows usually fails to go to sleep, or wakes up for no reason, thus keeping me down to about 5 minutes of useful battery life for the last 9 months or so. However, I have become accustomed to the freedom of moving my laptop from my office to the living room, when I just want to hang out and relax in front of the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">TV, </span></span>or to Starbuck&#8217;s or the juice place, when I want to do work away from my little office. But then I wrote half of a draft of this entry, decided to move from my living room to my office, unplugged my laptop, and there went 350 words. This will be a strange new lifestyle to get used to; or I may just brave the fire and leave the battery in. The world, after all, is a dangerous place anyway.</p>

					<h3><a name="002722"> </a>A Brief Commentary on the Apple Stock Option Trouble</h3>
	    			<p class="date">Aug 12, 2006 in <a href="#">Business</a></p>
   					<p>I&#8217;ve had a couple of friends IM me today asking me &#8220;what&#8217;s going on with the whole <a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1155027932371">Apple stock option <span class="caps">SEC </span>trouble thing</a>?&#8221; Now, I know nothing more about this than the average business school student with a few classes on options and on financial reporting, but I guess that&#8217;s a few more than average so I&#8217;ll expound a bit on what appears to be going on, and if it&#8217;s serious or not. Everything below should be taken with a small grain of salt, at least, since there have been no public, comprehensive statements on what&#8217;s going on by either Apple or the <span class="caps">SEC, </span>but the stories in the press appear to be quite consistent and clear in what they&#8217;re describing. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002722.php">Read on&#8230;</a> (<a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002722.php#comments">plus 1 Comments</a>)</p>
	
					<h3><a name="002720"> </a>Clearly I'm Insensitive to Issues of International Politics and Security</h3>
					<p class="date">Aug 11, 2006 <a href="#">Politics</a></p>
  						<p>While hearing about the latest round of foiled terrorists and new flight security restrictions, all I&#8217;ve been able to think is &#8220;thank goodness I didn&#8217;t have to fly across the Pacific without my iPod, water, and hand lotion!&#8221; I realize this makes me a complete boor. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002720.php">Read on&#8230;</a> (<a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002720.php#comments">plus 5 Comments</a>)</p>
   		
					<h3><a name="002717"> </a>Just Go Ahead and Pay the Freakin Football Players!</h3>
	   				<p class="date">Aug 10, 2006 <a href="#">Spurts</a></p>
		   			<p>College football season&#8217;s on its way, which means, naturally, that the sports pages are full of stories of <span class="caps">NCAA </span>violations. Some, such as Oklahoma quarterback <a href="http://www.tulsaworld.com/NewsStory.asp?ID=060803_Ne_A1_TwoSo69334">Rhett Bomar&#8217;s accepting money for a job he didn&#8217;t do</a> are relatively serious.</p>
		   			<p>Others, such as <span class="caps">USC </span>reciever <a href="http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-usc10aug10,0,3529500.story?coll=la-home-sports">Dale Jarrett&#8217;s roommate&#8217;s father paying for a luxury apartment</a> are simply a sign that the existing system, which effectively prohibits most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_I">Division I</a> scholar-athletes from holding any useful job, is badly broken and needs to be fixed. Specifically, it needs to be possible for Division I schools to pay their athletes for playing sports. <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002717.php">Read on&#8230;</a> (<a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002717.php#comments">plus 1 Comments</a>)</p>

   					<p>If you&#8217;re like the friends I instant message with &#8212; and who isn&#8217;t, these days &#8212; then you took one look at my <a href="http://juniorbird.smugmug.com/Travel/200720">Southeast Asia vacation photos</a> and said &#8220;hey, there are more than 400 photos here! Aren&#8217;t any of them good?&#8221; The answer, of course, is &#8220;sorry, no!&#8221; But, despite that unfortunate fact, I&#8217;ve collected this &#8220;best of&#8221; list so that you can pretend to have looked at my photos, and compliment me on them, while not actually having to wade (heh) through them! And away we go! <a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002715.php">Read on&#8230;</a> (<a href="http://juniorbird.com/archive/002715.php#comments">plus 2 Comments</a>)</p>

					<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty sure that it is the first time in more than 1000 years that a non-governmental group of non-Jews has attacked a group of Jews and suffered in any way&#8230; A substantial subset of Lebanese citizens decides that they would like to kill Jews and that therefore it would be fun to launch some rockets into the residential neighborhoods of Israel. They expect to enjoy this activity for many months or years&#8230; What happened this time? The Jews, armed to the teeth, came over to where the rockets were being fired and made the place unlivable.&#8221; An alternative take from the below link.</p>

					<p>&#8220;Israel meant to break Hezbollah with its monthlong offensive, but instead the militant organization has been strengthened politically in Lebanon, analysts say. The movement has a fresh boost of popularity, at least for now, and a renewed sense that it is entitled to keep its armed militia outside the control of the Lebanese army, they say.&#8221;</p>

					<p>&#8220;According to data released today by the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">U.S.</span></span> Census Bureau, the ratio of men to women in Maryland is among the lowest in the nation, with fewer than 93 men for every 100 women here. Only the District of Columbia and Mississippi have more lopsided gender ratios. Looking for the best odds to find a man? Try Alaska, with its 103 men to every 100 women - some towns, with up to 120 men per 100 women, have even tried to recruit women to move there.&#8221; Maybe I should move!</p>

					<p>&#8220;They found 60% of 30-year-old women wanted sex &#8220;often&#8221; at the beginning of a relationship, but within four years of the relationship this figure fell to under 50%, and after 20 years it dropped to about 20%. In contrast, they found the proportion of men wanting regular sex remained at between 60-80%, regardless of how long they had been in a relationship. &#8220;</p>
